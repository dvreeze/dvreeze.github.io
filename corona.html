        <h1>COVID-19</h1>
        <p>It's May 23, 2020. We have pretty much all been in lockdown for quite a while now, worldwide. Therefore we have had plenty of time to reflect on the COVID-19 "pandemic" situation, and maybe also on our lives and on what is truly important, provided we do not live in fear. I have to say that like many others I strongly feel that in these crazy times nothing is like it seems. Fortunately many courageous people are stepping forward to expose enormous (official) lies that are told by the "authorities". Some of these brave individuals look at a bigger picture and try to make sense of it all, warning us of what they see coming, but possibly also showing a way out of this mess. I would like to highlight all of this in this small article, by linking to several informative articles.

<a name="We-are-not-being-told-the-truth" class="anchor" href="#yaidom"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are clearly not being told the truth</h3>

<p>Today it is May 23, 2020, and we have been in lockdown for more than 2 months now, due to an alleged (?) Corona virus pandemic. Right from the beginning, several things did not add up, such as the Event 201 exercise a few weeks before the start of the outbreak. To many of us, including me, it did not pass the smell test. In particular, it did not look like a natural phenomenon requiring us to protect society from disease by isolating ourselves. Here I would like to contribute to the establishment of truth by linking to several quite informative articles.</p>

<p>Let's first mention the despicable role played by the mainstream media. More than ever before they show how they are controlled by a very powerful network that includes big pharmaceutical corporations. The mainstream media expose themselves as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They keep us in fear (or at least try to do so), because fear is and always has been the currency of control</li>
<li>They promote the WHO party line, which basically says that nothing will help against the virus until "the vaccine" is ready</li>
<li>They fail to expose obvious crimes against humanity (now or in the past) perpetrated by the main players, and the huge profits they make from the misery of everyone else</li>
<li>They attack cures that work, in any way possible (for example by character assassination)</li>
<li>They keep us divided along increasingly many lines of division (division and fear have controlled us for thousands of years)</li>
<li>"Fact checking" (as if the biased media have a monopoly on the truth)</li>
<li>They openly demand the silencing of truth tellers (just look at the despicable treatment of Julian Assange)</li>
</ul>

<p>This brings us to the topic of censorship. The tech giants like Facebook and Google have ramped up their censorship of every narrative that challenges the WHO religion to unimaginable levels. If there is anything that clearly shows that the official COVID-19 narrative is BS, it would be the <em>absurd level of censorship</em> facing all of us questioning the official narrative.</p>

<p>Nothing is new in this vast conspiracy involving the MSM, of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lied about Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction, killing more than a million Iraqis based on this lie</li>
<li>They lied about 9/11</li>
<li>They lied about Assad's supposed chemical warfare against his own people</li>
<li>They lied about MH17 (especially here in the Netherlands)</li>
<li>And so on, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>This time, however, they seem to throw in everything they have got left of their power, afraid as they are of an awakening world population. After all, they are few and we are many, and <em>if we find out about our true power, their power basically evaporates</em>.</p>

<p>So let's link to several informative articles trying to make sense of it all. I do not think that anyone knows the full truth, and that's ok. I only ask the reader to <em>keep an open mind</em>, take whatever resonates with you, and ignore the rest. We are all in this together, evolving towards a higher level of consciousness, because that's the only way to get out of this mess (recalling what Einstein said about solving fundamental problems, namely that it requires a different mindset than the mindset that created the problems in the first place).</p>

<p>Remember that we do not need to know the full truth in order to expose blatant lies. It's the same with 9/11: I don't know what happened on that fateful day, but I sure as hell know that the official narrative is a bunch of criminal lies. Those lies are so </em>big that they are hard to fathom. That may be even more so the case with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Having said that, there is probably a <em>very bright side to all of this</em>. If there was ever a time that required humanity to overcome its differences and become more mature and loving as a species, it would be now. This crisis is our collective chance to create a bright future for all of us, by <em>removing our perceptual chains and creating a positive path forward instead</em>.</p>

<li>but then, as David Icke says: <a href="https://www.davidicke.com/article/570608/not-grant-freedom-david-icke" target="_blank">you don't grant me my freedom</a>; we really have to refuse to live in fear and slavery, and choose courage, wisdom, compassion and freedom instead</li>
<li>and choose empowering information, of which (in my opinion) <a href="http://www.paulstramer.net/2020/05/the-truth-behind-covid-19-curtain.html" target="_blank">this interview with Dr. Zach Bush</a> is an excellent example, because it expands our thinking about viruses, disease, medicine, science and life itself</li>
</ul>

<p>It's far from easy, emotionally, to process this information, but how else can we evolve as a species and prevent our own extinction? But that's where we are. We are at a fork in the road. We are forced to choose between 2 paradigms, as I see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear and limitation:
  <ul>
    <li>The authorities know best, and want the best for you</li>
    <li>Obey the authorities, and follow their orders without questioning</li>
    <li>Take the vaccine (blessed by Bill Gates) once it has arrived</li>
    <li>Be afraid of all threats the authorities tell you to be afraid of (IS, Iran, Russia, SARS, Ebola, Covid, etc.)</li>
    <li>You are small and insignificant</li>
    <li>Your body is weak</li>
    <li>You are ill and a threat to society unless proven otherwise (CertificateOfVaccinationID19)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Expanded awareness:
  <ul>
    <li>You are a <em>sovereign being</em></li>
    <li>You have a birthright to a positive life experience</li>
    <li>You can trust your inner guidance, and certainly do not need any authorities telling you what to believe and what not to believe</li>
    <li>Your body is extremely intelligent, and quite capable of processing the information it gets from viruses etc.</li>
    <li>You are a very powerful creator</li>
    <li>Hence, choose your thoughts wisely, because thoughts attract reality</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you think of it, the choice should not be too hard, right? Especially when you consider the future of your children and grandchildren. Even if this means that a lot of inner work, positive action, and removal of fear is needed for that.</p>
