        <h1>COVID-19</h1>
        <p>It's May 22, 2020. We have pretty much all been in lockdown for quite a while now, worldwide, and have had plenty of time to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic situation (and maybe also on our lives and on what is truly important). I have to say, with many others I strongly feel that in these crazy times nothing is like it seems. Fortunately many courageous people are stepping forward to expose enormous (official) lies, or even to try to make sense of it all, and to warn us of what they see coming. I would like to highlight that in this small article.

<a name="We-are-not-being-told-the-truth" class="anchor" href="#yaidom"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are clearly not being told the truth</h3>

<p>Today it is May 22, 2020, and we have been in lockdown for more than 2 months now, due to an alleged (?) Corona virus pandemic. Right from the beginning, several things did not add up. To many of us, including me, it smelled like multiple competing worldwide agendas playing out at the same time, instead of a natural phenomenon requiring us to protect society from disease by isolating ourselves. Here I would like to contribute to "truth finding" by linking to several quite informative articles.</p>

<p>Let's first mention the despicable role played by the mainstream media. More than ever before they show how they are controlled by very powerful corporations, including large pharmaceutical companies and a parasitic banking cartel. They do so as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping us in fear (or at least trying to do so), because fear is and always has been the currency of control</li>
<li>Promoting the WHO party line, which basically says that nothing will help against the virus until "the vaccine" is ready</li>
<li>Failing to expose obvious crimes against humanity (now or in the past) perpetrated by the main players, and the huge profits they make from the misery of everyone else</li>
<li>Attacking cures that work, in any way possible (especially by character assassination)</li>
<li>Keeping us divided along increasingly many lines of division (division and fear have controlled us for thousands of years)</li>
<li>"Fact checking" (as if the biased media have a monopoy on the truth)</li>
<li>Openly demanding the silencing of truth tellers (just look at the despicable treatment of Julian Assange)</li>
</ul>

<p>And this brings us to the topic of censorship. The tech giants have ramped up their censorship of every narrative that challenges the WHO religion to unimaginable levels. If there is anything that clearly shows that the official COVID-19 narrative is BS, it would be the absurd level of censorship facing all of us questioning the official narrative.</p>

<p>Nothing is new in this vast conspiracy involving the MSM, of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lied about Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction, killing more than a million Iraqis based on this lie</li>
<li>They lied about 9/11</li>
<li>They lied about Assad's supposed chemical warfare against his own people</li>
<li>They lied about MH17 (especially here in the Netherlands)</li>
<li>And so on, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>This time, however, they seem to throw in everything they have got left of their power, afraid as they are of an awakening world population. After all, they are few and we are many, and if we find out about our true power, their power basically evaporates.</p>

<p>So let's link to several informative articles trying to make sense of it all. I do not think that anyone knows the full truth, and that's ok. I only ask you to keep an open mind, take whatever resonates with you, and ignore the rest. We are all in this together, evolving towards a higher level of consciousness, because that's the only way to get out of this mess (recalling what Einstein said about solving fundamental problems, namely that it requires a different mindset than the mindset that created the problems in the first place).</p>

<p>Remember that we do not need to know the full truth in order to expose blatant lies. It's the same with 9/11: I don't know what happened that fateful day, but I sure as hell know that the official narrative is a bunch of criminal lies. Those lies are so big that they are hard to fathom. That may be even more so the case with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Having said that, there is probably a very bright side to all of this. If there was ever a time that required humanity to overcome its differences and become more mature and loving as a species, it would be now. This crisis is our collective chance to create a bright future for all of us, by removing our perceptual chains and creating a positive experience instead.</p>

</ul>

<p>It's far from easy, emotionally, to process this information, but how else can we evolve as a species and prevent our own extinction? But that's where we are. We are forced to choose between 2 paradigms, as I see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The authorities know best, obey them, follow their orders, and take the vaccine (blessed by Bill Gates) once it has arrived. In other words, you are small, insignificant, and ill unless proven otherwise (CertificateOfVaccinationID19)</li>
<li>You are a sovereign being, you have a birthright to a positive life experience, you have inner guidance  and do not need any authorities telling you what to do and not to do, and you are a very powerful (co)creator</li>
</ul>
<p>When you think of it, the choice should not be too hard, right? Especially when you consider the future of your children and grandchildren. Even if this means that a lot of inner work, positive action, and removal of fear is needed for that.</p>
