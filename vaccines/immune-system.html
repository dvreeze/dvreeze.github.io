    <h1>Immune system</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p><em>This document summarizes the material of week 1 of the MVI Boot Camp, by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.</em></p>

    <p>The <em>immune system</em> is the body's natural defense mechanism that helps fight or limit infections.</p>

    <p>It consists of numerous types of cells that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>either circulate through the body</li>
      <li>or reside in particular tissue</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Different types of cells play a different role and recognize problems in different ways. They also communicate with other
cells. Thus they are able to perform their individual functions.</p>

    <p>Things learned in this presentation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why it is important to keep the skin microbiome healthy and intact</li>
      <li>The role of toll-like receptors in daily health</li>
      <li>Dendritic cells as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems</li>
      <li>Differences between neutrophils and macrophages</li>
      <li>The important connection between macrophages and monocytes</li>
      <li>Five types of antibodies, and how they work</li>
      <li>How to explain all these elements, in order to understand the impact of mRNA injections on immune function</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is the immune system?</h2>

    <p>The immune system, which helps fight and limit infections, at a high level consists of 3 categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Barrier</em> immunity</li>
      <li><em>Innate</em> immunity</li>
      <li><em>Acquired</em> (or <em>adaptive</em>) immunity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The skin is the most obvious example of an organ playing a part in the barrier immune system.</p>

    <p>Internal organs may have a barrier immune system as well. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lungs: cilia and mucous</li>
      <li>Stomach: low pH</li>
      <li>Sinus: turbinates, tonsils, saliva and enzymes</li>
      <li>GI/GU: mucosal surfaces</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Microbiomes vary between individuals and vary between different sites on the body. To keep the skin microbiome healthy, avoid hand
sanitizers and obsessive washing of your hands. This would harm the body's immune system, in particular its first line of defense.
After all, in the skin, the toll-like receptors distinguish between what is self and what is not, and they need to be able to perform
their function well. Note that the alcohol in hand sanitizers indiscriminately kills bacteria (the key word here is indiscriminately).</p>

    <p>Every square centimeter of skin contains about 1 million bacteria (several 100 distinct species). The entire body contains about
100 trillion (10 to the power of 14) (symbiotic) microbes in our various microbiomes. This implies that trying to obsessively decontaminate is
not going to get rid of them; moreover, we should not even try because we live in harmony with those microbes, and they also protect us.</p>

    <p>Another way of stating this relationship with our microbiomes is that we are all asymptomatic carriers. So why all this panic about
one specific virus that has not even been properly isolated? A positive PCR test (if it says anything at all) does not mean that we are
sick (especially if we are asymptomatic), but it means that we have been exposed to a pathogen that is now part of our normal flora.
This is natural herd immunity. We have been controlled by FEAR: False Evidence Appearing Real. E.g. calling a positive test result a "case".
Now you are considered sick until "proven healthy" (like being guilty until proven innocent), using a fraudulent "test".</p>

    <p>A Wuhan study done around May 2020 showed that asymptomatic carriers testing positive did <em>not infect</em> other people. And for this
scam our societies have almost been destroyed (destroyed businesses, depression, reduced immunity, etc. etc.)?</p>

    <p>A high level overview of how innate and (if applicable) adaptive immunity fight infections (that have already passed through the barriers,
invading the blood stream):</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Innate immunity</em>:
        <p>Toll-like receptors (at the cell boundaries) sense pathogens (foreign proteins) by <em>pattern recognition</em>.
When TLRs find something foreign to the body, they send out cytokines and call neutrophils into action. If that does not kill the invader,
fever is induced, which is a good thing. Then cytokines are sent out to call in the "troops". Some of them are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>NK (natural killer) cells (intracellular)</li>
          <li>Phagocytes (extracellular)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Adaptive immunity</em>:
        <p>If innate immunity alone did not kill the infection, the adaptive immune system springs into action:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>T-helper cells, and then B-cells and antibodies (extracellular or intracellular)</li>
          <li>Cytotoxic T-cells (intracellular)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>After toll-like receptors recognize infections, fever and (naturally controlled) cytokine storms are natural response mechanisms to
fight those infections.</p>

    <h3>Innate immune response (TH1 immune response)</h3>

    <p>The innate immune system is characterized as follows (as opposed to the adaptive immune system):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is already present at birth. (The idea that babies are born without immune system is nonsense.)</li>
      <li>It is non-specific.</li>
      <li>Its response time is fast (minutes to hours).</li>
      <li>It is not very potent.</li>
      <li>It can be inherited.</li>
      <li>Its components are neutrophils, monocytes, MPh (macrophages), mast/eos/basos, NK cells, dendritic cells.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some subjects in this section are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Toll-like-receptors</li>
      <li>Neutrophils</li>
      <li>Monocytes --&gt; Macrophages</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Toll-like receptors</h4>

    <p>The theory of innate immunity centralizes around the super-vigilant TLRs (toll-like receptors).
TLRs <em>innately</em> know the difference between <em>what is self and what is foreign</em>.</p>

    <p>TLRs recognize pathogens by <em>pattern recognition</em>. They trigger specific immune responses. In that sense, they can be seen as traffic agents, directing "traffic" to any of many types of cells that fight infection. Hence, TLRs are really amazing.</p>

    <p>The history of this young theory of TLRs is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>1989: Charles Janeway proposed a general theory of innate immune recognition (pattern recognition theory).
He predicted that activation of the adaptive immune response was controlled by a mechanism that had not yet been discovered.</li>
      <li>1996: TLRs in fruit flies discovered</li>
      <li>1997: First human TLR discovered, later named TLR4</li>
      <li>2011: Jules Hoffmann and Bruce Beutler received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their work regarding innate immunity</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So far, 10 TLRs have been recognized in humans (of which TLR 10 is not yet understood):<p>
    <ul>
      <li>TLRs 1, 2, 4, and 6 are located on the cell surface. They recognize <em>bacterial lipids</em>, primarily <em>LPS</em>.</li>
      <li>TLRs 3, 7 and 8 interface between cytosol and outside the cell (endosome). They recognize <em>viral RNA</em>.</li>
      <li>TLR 9 also interfaces between cytosol and outside the cell (endosome). They recognize <em>bacterial DNA</em>.</li>
      <li><em>TLR 5</em> has the sole function of recognizing <em>flagellin</em> on bacteria and parasites.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This system of TLRs should be admired for its beauty, instead of having vaccine manufacturers add adjuvants that manipulate the TLRs.</p>

    <h4>Neutrophils versus macrophages</h4>

    <p>Macrophages and neutrophils are leukocytes. They cannot replace each other. Instead, they are complementary and cooperative partners:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They both secrete proinflammatory cytokines.</li>
      <li>They both affect innate immunity by killing pathogens.</li>
      <li>Neutrophils transfer intracellular pathogens to macrophages.</li>
      <li>Neutrophils enhance the macrophage's ability to phagocytize.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A more detailed comparison between macrophages and neutrophils is as follows:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Neutrophils</th>
        <th>Macrophages</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Granular leukocytes, comprising of a nucleus with 3 to 5 lobes</td>
        <td>Large leukocytes that engulf foreign particles in the body</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Nucleus is multi-lobed</td>
        <td>Nucleus has a large, rounded shape</td>
      </tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Make up 2 to 8% of circulating white blood cells</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Consists of Ly6G+, and MPO+ receptors on the cell membrane</td>
        <td>Consists of EMR1+, CD107b+ (Mac-3+), and CD68+ receptors on the cell membrane</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mature in the bone marrow</td>
        <td>Mature in tissues</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Lifespan is weeks to months</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>First to attack bacteria at the site of infection</td>
        <td>Engulf large particles and pathogens</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mature neutrophils are found in circulation</td>
        <td>Very few macrophages can be found in circulation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mature neutrophils do not reside in connective tissues</td>
        <td>Mature macrophages normally reside in connective tissues</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No phenotypic variations are observed</td>
        <td>Comprise of phenotypically varied sub-populations in distinct tissues</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Monocytes, the precursors of macrophages</h4>

    <p>Monocytes, another important class of leukocytes (being part of the innate immune system), make up 1 to 10% of the leukocytes in
circulation. Their primary functions are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phagocytosis ("garbage eaters")</li>
      <li>Antigen presentation: "holding the pathogens up" for B-cells to come along and create antibodies for long time immunity</li>
      <li>Helping with the creation of cytokines when a heavy proinflammatory reaction is needed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These monocytes move into infected tissue and there become macrophages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>M1 macrophages</em> are proinflammatory. They help create cytokines.</li>
      <li><em>M2 macrophages</em> are anti-inflammatory. They are the "cleanup crew".</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Eosinophils and basophils</h4>

    <p>Other leukocytes making up the innate immune system are eosinophils and basophils:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Eosinophils</th>
        <th width="50%">Basophils</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>About 1 to 2% of leukocytes</td>
        <td>About 0.5 to 1% of leukocytes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>They are specialized leukocytes. They generally have 2 lobes and contain about 200 enzyme-containing granules with various
functions</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>They fight multicellular parasites and some bacteria</td>
        <td>They play an important role in fighting parasitic infections</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Frequently associated with allergies, asthma etc.</td>
        <td>Often seen in allergic reactions, preventing blood clotting</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Adaptive immune response (TH2 immune response)</h3>

    <p>The adaptive immune system is characterized as follows (as opposed to the innate immune system):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It develops (i.e. matures) after birth.</li>
      <li>It is specific.</li>
      <li>Its response time is slow: days to weeks.</li>
      <li>It is strongly potent.</li>
      <li>It is not inherited.</li>
      <li>Its components are dendritic cells, T-cells, B-cells, antibodies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some subjects in this section are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>T-cells</li>
      <li>B-cells</li>
      <li>Antibodies</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Dendritic cells bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.</p>

    <h4>Dendritic cells</h4>

    <p>Dendritic cells are located in tissues that are in contact with the external environment, such as lungs, stomach, intestines,
pharynx and nasal passages. <em>Dendritic cells are the bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.</em></p>

    <p><em>Dendritic cells (DC) are activated by TLRs.</em></p>

    <p>DC identify antigens on the surface of pathogens, process them and then present them to T-cells which interface with B-cells
to make <em>neutralizing antibodies</em>.</p>

    <p>DC maturation enables activation of B-cells and NK cells, and promotes the recruitment of other immune cells to eliminate the pathogen.</p>

    <h4>Lymphocytes</h4>

    <p><em>T-cells</em> mature in the thymus under the effect of the hormone <em>thymosin</em>. About 80% of the circulating lymphocytes
are T-cells.</p>

    <p>There are several types of T-cells:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>T-killer cells, or cytotoxic T-cells</li>
      <li>T-helper cells</li>
      <li>T-suppressor cells</li>
      <li>T-memory cells</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>B-cells</em> are involved in humoral/adaptive immunity. They recognize foreign antigens and produce specific antibodies against
them.</p>

    <p>T-helper cells activate B-cells to produce antibodies.</p>

    <p><em>Natural killer (NK) cells</em> destroy cells infected by bacteria or viruses.</p>

    <h4>Antibodies</h4>

    <p>Note that the focus of vaccines is on creation of antibodies, as if we need vaccines to do that.</p>

    <p>A typical antibody looks like the capital letter <em>Y</em>. The upper parts are the <em>Fab fragments</em>, and the "stem"
is the <em>Fac fragments</em>. The Fab fragments bind to antigens and the Fac fragments bind to receptors on various leukocytes
and tissues.</p>

    <p>Antibodies are also called <em>immunoglobin</em> (<em>Ig</em>). There are 5 types of antibodies (think GAMED):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>IgM</em>
        <ul>
          <li>It is the first antibody formed by B-cells in response to an infection.</li>
          <li>It is very large, usually formed as a pentimeter.</li>
          <li>It binds to activated proteins in circulation called <em>complement</em> to neutralize the foreign pathogens.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>IgG</em>
        <ul>
          <li>It is the most common type of antibody.</li>
          <li>It is the main <em>humoral response of the TH2 pathways</em>.</li>
          <li>Its primary function is to neutralize pathogens.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>IgE</em>
        <ul>
          <li>It is the antibody with the lowest serum concentration and shortest serum half-life.</li>
          <li>It is very potent, and it is associated with allergic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions. It also responds to
parasitic worm infections.</li>
          <li>When binding to an antigen, the Fac fragment binds to mast cells, eosinophils and basophils, leading to allergic reactions. When
severe, the reaction is called <em>anaphylaxis</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>IgA</em>
        <ul>
          <li>It is the first line of defense inside the intestinal tract.</li>
          <li>They are found on the surface of mucous membranes in the gut, lungs and urinary tract.</li>
          <li>They are also found in tears, sweat, saliva and colostrum.</li>
          <li>It is the most abundant antibody.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>IgD</em>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a minor class of immunoglobulins.</li>
          <li>They somehow work with B-cells to neutralize pathogens, but the precise functions of membrane IgD are not known yet.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Our immune system is <em>beautiful and highly intelligent</em>, especially if we take the young but promising science of <em>TLRs</em>
into account. It is something to be admired, not something to be abused and manipulated.</p>

    <p>Then why do we need vaccines, or even mRNA injections? The latter are <em>non-FDA-improved</em>, <em>experimental</em> and their
<em>long term effects are unknown</em>, and they are not even vaccines.</p>
