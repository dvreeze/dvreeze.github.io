<p>Under normal circumstances I would stick to tech stuff on this site. Yet we do not live under normal circumstances. Free speech is being attacked from multiple angles, and we have even got to the point where we censor ourselves ("political correctness"). When you think about it, this makes perfect sense if a small "elite" wants to control the many: just convince the sheeple to suppress themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot be silent about this. If we do not speak up about suppression of freedom, we will soon have no freedom left. We can and must do better than keeping silent, if not for ourselves, then at least for our children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Obviously there are plenty of wrongs in this world:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is never enough money to feed the homeless, but there is always plenty of money for war.</li>
<li>The US empire has many military bases all over the world, a large portion of them as close as possible to Russia and China.</li>
<li>The US has hardly ever been attacked from abroad, but does not hesitate to attack other countries very far from their own borders, bombing them into "democracies".</li>
<li>Judging from the results, often the point is not even to win a war, but to have perpetual warfare. That is a crime against humanity.</li>
<li>Governments (especially the US government) have no problem killing their own people in false flag attacks or otherwise, putting the blame elsewhere.</li>
<li>Several false flag attacks have even been declassified, such as operations Northwoods and Gladio.</li>
<li>The official story on 9/11 could be demolished by a child (and don't forget building 7, which, in spite of not being hit, decided to collapse in free fall, in solidarity with towers 1 and 2).</li>
<li>Several former US presidents ("conspiracy theorists") have warned us about the hidden powers that suppress humanity.</li>
<li>Apparently it is considered to be ok to drop 2 atomic bombs on innocent Japanese civilians, even when Japan was ready to surrender.</li>
<li>Likewise, it is apparently ok to "regime change" countless countries that pose no threat other than to "national security" (which is the ultimate excuse to kill, maim and pillage).</li>
<li>Printing unlimited amounts of "money" (not backed by anything of value) while forcing others to accept this worthless currency as payments is another huge scam.</li>
<li>Handing over control of money to a private corporation (the Federal Reserve, which is neither federal nor has anything in reserve) was an act of treason.</li>
<li>The despicable MSM (in the West) cowardly blames each problem on Russia, as instructed by the CIA.</li>
<li>Western hypocrisy has reached astronomical proportions, especially about meddling in affairs of other countries.</li>
<li>But then, we know some of the really unforgivable crimes of Russia (at one level): stopping the Rothschild mafia (that controls the US, Europe and many more regions) in Syria, and stopping the hegemony of the once almighty dollar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wrongs in the world do not stop there, of course (it is now December 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li>We have geo-engineering and weather warfare being used against us. See for example <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/confronting-geoengineer-david-keith/" target="_blank">confronting geo-engineer David Keith</a>. Looking the other way does not make this problem go away.</li>
<li>The agenda behind geo-engineering is very dark and tightly linked to the transhumanism agenda, as <a href="https://www.aircrap.org/haarp-elana-freeland/" target="_blank">Elana Freeland</a> and others expose.</li>
<li>Speaking of transhumanism, is it a coincidence that male fertility is decreasing, or that we all of a sudden have 50 or so different genders and therefore victim groups (divide-and-conquer)?</li>
<li>The EU does all it can to destroy our sovereignty, with "trade agreements" (TTIP, CETA, TiSA, etc.) calling for secret tribunals protecting the multinationals at the expense of the people, thus destroying what little is left of our freedom.</li>
<li>Ministries of propaganda, by some called "media", openly <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/27285-ny-times-promotes-antifa-communist-coup-effort-against-trump-for-nov-4" target="_blank">promote a violent coup in the US</a>.</li>
<li>Of course, the fingerprints of the likes of George Soros are all over it. Creating chaos under the guise of promoting democracy is a Soros specialty. Fortunately so far he has failed to destroy Europe with his engineered migrant crisis.</li>
<li>If you want to create a Russian threat out of thin air, John McCain is your man. When he appeared on Dutch television immediately after the downing of MH17, and immediately blaming Russia, I knew this was yet another con job.<li>
<li>Evil companies like Monsanto poison our food (e.g. Roundup), "rebuild nature" (GMOs, Roundup-resistent crops, etc.), thus making a fortune and owning much of the food chain (or so they think in their hubris)</li>
<li>Like food, water is also weaponized, for example by adding toxic waste like fluoride. The <a href="http://www.stopthecrime.net/smartmeters/toxicdrinkingwater/How%20did%20the%20Flouride%20Scam%20Begin_.pdf" target="_blank">history of the fluoride scam</a> is quite informative about what is wrong in this world and how easily we are conned.</li>
<li>The CDC lied about the absence of any connection between MMR vaccines and autism. Why are vaccine producers immune to prosecution, why are poor countries flooded with vaccines that are not legal elsewhere, why is even any constructive discussion about vaccine safety "verboten" and are credible but critical people silenced?</li>
<li>Speaking of boundaries on free speech: why is the slighest critique of Israel enough to be branded a "holocaust denier" and/or "anti-semite"?</li>
<li>Successful treatments of (supposedly deadly) diseases like cancer are hidden from us.</li>
<li>Many children are abducted, brutally abused and sacrificed. Many of these children's organs are sold. What is our answer: Wir haben es nicht gewusst?</li>
<li>I am forgetting very many more crimes against humanity.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is pretty much known to people who take the time to investigate. There are some recurring themes that help make sense of it. One such theme is that <em>all misery in the world is a business model</em>. (I believe it was Ronald Bernard who said that.) To put it bluntly: there is no need for war, poverty and disease:</p>
<ol>
<li>War is extremely good business for the "elite", as general Smedley Butler explained in his book "War is a Racket".</li>
<li>So is poverty. Ask Bill Gates with his vaccine depopulation program in developing countries.</li>
<li>Disease is another cash cow. Cancer could be cured in 1934, by Dr. Royal Rife. His treatment had a 100% success rate, but there was no money to be made from his treatment, so the medical-industrial complex destroyed him. We are not allowed to know about this, and must stick to the far less successful and far more intrusive chemo/radiation/surgery regimens instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we understand that misery is a business model (and more), it becomes clear that it does not have to be that way.</p>

<p>Another common theme is that <em>most misery does not happen by chance, but is planned carefully</em>. This is also known of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd world wars. They are just banker wars, and planned mass genocides. During WW2, the "opposing parties" were happily discussing at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel who would deliver what for the "play". The US (Ford Corporation) delivered tanks to Nazi Germany, for example. Prescott Bush financed the Nazis, but that certainly did not prevent the Bush crime family from delivering 2 US presidents.</p>

<p>Who plans all that misery? <em>Qui bono?</em> One technique is to <em>follow the money</em>, of course. That requires real journalism, of a kind that is rarely seen nowadays (although good citizen journalism seems to be on the rise). All this misery is far from isolated. There is a huge conspiracy connecting them, as shown by David Icke, for example. Remember: several US presidents and other powerful men (like Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda) said the same. There is a major war against all of humanity, of a scale and depth that is hard to fathom.</p>

<p>David Icke gave us 2 other terms that help in understanding what is going on: PRS, or <em>problem-reaction-solution</em>, and <em>totalitarian tiptoe</em>. Related is the old principle of <em>divide-et-impera</em>. For those who ridicule David for his remarks on "shapeshifting reptilians" I would like to say: much of what he said decades ago is unfolding now, and truth can be stranger than fiction. To appreciate that it does not help to concentrate on details without looking at the big picture. Moreover, if he is mad, why are the authorities so scared of him? Why is he banned from several venues? I think the answer is obvious: the authorities are shitting their pants because of what he has to say on the nature of reality.</p>

<p>Anyway, PRS helps in understanding false flag attacks. Create a problem (like some disease), lie about the cause and the cure, and scare the shit out of the people. Then wait for the reaction of the public ("please protect us"). Then offer the solution (like forced vaccinations). In the process, the people (voluntarily) lose more of their freedom.</p>

<p>The totalitarian tiptoe is more like a "slow" process in which gradually people lose their freedom without noticing, step by step, after each step getting used to the new status quo. It is like being frogs in water that is slowly boiling. The terms PRS and totalitarian tiptoe are important tools to understand how we are being played.</p>

<p>The upside is that more and more people awaken to the fact that they are being screwed, and that to a large extent non-violent non-cooperation is the answer. Another very good thing is that if we have been lied to about everything, then we are probably far more powerful and sovereign than we have been made to believe. Hence, we can create a better world by changing our perceptions from the programmed ones to the ones coming from our hearts. If war, poverty and disease have been artificially created (which is indeed the case), then we can collectively make other far more constructive choices.</p>

<p>So I am trying to be truthful, thus changing my perceptions and therefore changing my reality. It is encouraging to see that many people try to do the same.</p>
