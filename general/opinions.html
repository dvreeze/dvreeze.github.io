<p>Under normal circumstances I would stick to tech stuff on this site. Yet we do not live under normal circumstances. Free speech is being attacked from multiple angles, and we have even got to the point where we censor ourselves ("political correctness"). When you think about it, this makes perfect sense if a small "elite" wants to control the many: just convince the sheeple to suppress themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot be silent about this. If we do not speak up about suppression of freedom, we will soon have no freedom left. We can and must do better than keeping silent, if not for ourselves, then at least for our children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Obviously there are plenty of wrongs in this world:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is never enough money to feed the homeless, but there is always plenty of money for war.</li>
<li>Governments (especially the US government) have no problem killing their own people, while putting the blame elsewhere.</li>
<li>Several false flag attacks have even been declassified, such as operations Northwoods and Gladio.</li>
<li>The official story on 9/11 could be demolished by a toddler (and don't forget building 7).</li>
<li>Several former US presidents ("conspiracy theorists") have warned us about the hidden powers that suppress humanity.</li>
<li>Apparently it is ok to drop 2 atomic bombs on innocent civilians.</li>
<li>Or to "regime change" countless countries that pose no threat other than to "national security" (which is the excuse to kill, maim and pillage).</li>
<li>Printing unlimited amounts of "money" (not backed by anything of value) while forcing others to accept this worthless currency as payments is another huge scam.</li>
<li>The despicable MSM (in the West) cowardly blames each problem on Russia.</li>
<li>Western hypocrisy has reached astronomical proportions, especially about meddling in affairs of other countries.</li>
<li>But then, we know the really unforgivable crimes of Russia: stopping the Rothschild mafia (that controls the US, Europe and much of the rest of the planet) in Syria, and stopping the hegemony of the once almighty dollar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wrongs in the world do not stop there, of course (it is now December 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li>We have geo-engineering and weather warfare being used against us.</li>
<li>The EU does all it can to destroy our sovereignty, with "trade agreements" calling for secret tribunals protecting the multinationals at the expense of the people.</li>
<li>Increasingly food and water are used as weapons against us.</li>
<li>So are vaccinations.</li>
<li>Successful treatments of (supposedly deadly) diseases are hidden from us.</li>
<li>Many children are abducted, brutally abused and sacrificed.</li>
<li>And so on, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all known to people who take the time to investigate. There are some recurring themes that help make sense of it. One such theme is that <em>all misery in the world is a business model</em>. (I believe it was Ronald Bernard who said that.) To put it bluntly: there is no need for war, poverty and disease:</p>
<ol>
<li>War is extremely good business for the "elite", as general Smedley Butler explained in his book "War is a Racket".</li>
<li>So is poverty. "Benign" companies like Monsanto are all too happy to "fight poverty", while making "a few" bucks out of it.</li>
<li>Disease is another cash cow. Cancer could be cured in 1934, by Dr. Royal Rife. His treatment had a 100% success rate, but there was no money to be made from his treatment, so the medical-industrial complex destroyed him. We are not allowed to know about this, and must stick to the far less successful and far more intrusive chemo/radiation/surgery regimens instead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another common theme is that <em>most misery does not happen by chance, but is planned carefully</em>. This is also known of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd world wars. They are just banker wars, and planned mass genocides. During WW2, the "opposing parties" were happily discussing at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel who would deliver what for the "play". The US (Ford Corporation) delivered tanks to Nazi Germany, for example.</p>

<p>David Icke gave us 2 other terms that help in understanding what is going on: PRS, or <em>problem-reaction-solution</em>, and <em>totalitarian tiptoe</em>. For those who ridicule David for his remarks on "shapeshifting reptilians" I would like to say: much of what he said decades ago is unfolding now, and truth can be stranger than fiction. To appreciate that it does not help to concentrate on details without looking at the big picture.</p>

<p>Anyway, PRS helps in understanding false flag attacks. Create a problem (like some disease), lie about the cause and the cure, and scare the shit out of the people. Then wait for the reaction of the public ("please protect us"). Then offer the solution (like forced vaccinations). In the process, the people (voluntarily) lose more of their freedom.</p>

<p>The totalitarian tiptoe is more like a "slow" process in which gradually people lose their freedom without noticing, step by step, after each step getting used to the new status quo. It is like being frogs in water that is slowly boiling. The terms PRS and totalitarian tiptoe are important tools to understand how we are being played.</p>

<p>The upside is that more and more people awaken to the fact that they are being screwed, and that to a large extent non-violent non-cooperation is the answer. Another very good thing is that if we have been lied to about everything, then we are probably far more powerful and sovereign than we have been made to believe. Hence, we can create a better world by changing our perceptions from the programmed ones to the ones coming from our hearts. If war, poverty and disease have been artificially created (which is indeed the case), then we can collectively make other far more constructive choices.</p>

<p>So I am trying to be truthful, thus changing my perceptions and therefore changing my reality. It is encouraging to see that many people try to do the same.</p>
