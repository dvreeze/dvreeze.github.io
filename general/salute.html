<p>In this crazy world, to a large extent run by satanic paedophiles (although this may be changing at this moment early in January
2018), I want to salute all people who fight for truth and justice, typically by exposing the unfolding dark agenda of the power
structure.</p>

<p>In case you think the "government" would not harm its citizens, or that you would know about it from the "media" if they did,
just search "How the fluoride scam began", as just one example of how easily we are duped.</p>

<p>Some courageous people fighting for truth are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ron Paul</li>
<li>Paul Craig Roberts</li>
<li>Dane Wigington (<a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org" target="_blank">www.geoengineeringwatch.org</a>)</li>
<li>Kevin Shipp</li>
<li>Robert David Steele</li>
<li>Fred Burks (<a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info" target="_blank">www.wanttoknow.info</a>)</li>
<li>John Pilger</li>
<li>Tom DeWeese (American Policy Center)</li>
<li>David Icke</li>
<li>Richie Allen (Richie Allen show)</li>
<li>Elana Freeland ("Under an ionized sky")</li>
<li>Mike Adams (the "Health Ranger")</li>
<li>Tom Feeley (<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info" target="_blank">www.informationclearinghouse.info</a>)</li>
<li>Patrick Gentempo (<a href="http://www.vaccinesrevealed.com" target="_blank">www.vaccinesrevealed.com</a>)</li>
<li>Robert Kennedy jr.</li>
<li>Ty Bollinger ("the truth about cancer")</li>
</ul>
<p>I also salute the many courageous like-minded people in their networks, well-known whistleblowers like Julian Assange,
Edward Snowden and John Kiriakou, as well as all others who selflessly fight for truth and justice.</p>

<p>These people may disagree on some points (Trump, climate change, etc.), and they may focus on different issues, but they are all courageous people who in
their own way fight (non-violently) for a better world. For example, Dane Wigington concentrates on climate engineering, because,
as he says, if our planet no longer supports life, nothing else matters. Speaking of which, why are we all silent when unspeakable
crimes against the web of life are committed above our heads and in our oceans, basically everywhere and almost every day? Don't
we love our children enough to fight for their future by exposing these crimes (see for example www.geoengineeringwatch.org)?</p>

<p>Many people (such as politicians of good will) may live under extreme pressure from the Cabal, but still want to do the right
thing. I wish them courage and wisdom.</p>

<p>Let's not forget that several US ex-presidents warned us about the out-of-control military-industrial complex. JFK even stepped
far outside the "allowed parameters", with fatal consequences. Others, like Eisenhower, gave similar warnings in their farewell
speech.</p>

<p>A hugely important history lesson was given by Russian president Putin in Munich, 2007. He exposed the US empire for what it is:
an empire that like so many empires before overstretches itself and destroys itself from within, while causing unimaginable
suffering in many parts of the world. We should all take notice of this speech. We should also shame our "media" for "forgetting"
this monumental speech, and for their relentless vilification of president Putin and Russia. To have a good laugh, please look
here: <a href="https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201712301060437717-2018-russophobia-russian-meddling/" target="_blank">russophobia</a>.</p>

<p>I want to give special mention to David Icke, who connects dots that are to a large extent not even seen, let alone connected
by most people. He clearly shows us that we have been lied to about everything, why that is the case, and how we can deal with it.
He goes very deeply into the rabbit hole, and has therefore been ridiculed enormously. Yet if he is mad, why did Germany close its
doors to him in 2017?</p>

<p>I also salute people like John Lamb Lash, who attempt to unveil the hidden history of the Gnostics, the Pagan intellectuals who
were brutally suppressed and murdered by religious zealots out of fear for their empowering (and highly politically incorrect)
message. The power structure is terrified of an empowered populace. You won't hear our controlled media talk (honestly) about the
very important Nag Hammadi Codices, found in 1945. Was there a peaceful world before the advent of mainstream religion? If so, what
can we learn from those civilisations? You also won't hear about the murder of Hypatia in 415, and its enormous historical
significance.</p>

<p>I also salute all those who work in the background to dismantle the satanic paedophile networks running this planet (at one
level at least), and who are prepared to sacrifice their lives for the liberation of this planet. This includes many highly
evolved humanoid and non-humanoid races fighting a hot and decisive (nearby) galactic war against the dark forces, and whom we
will finally meet again. Feel free to laugh at me for saying this, if you find this remark preposterous. On the other hand, if we
have been lied to about everything, why dismiss this idea without further investigation?</p>

<p>Counting on others for our liberation is not enough, though. We have to step up for truth and justice ourselves. This implies
that we have to understand how we are being played by the dark forces, who do everything they can to keep us in fear and ignorance,
in order to control us as their cattle and source of energy. As Einstein said: "You can never solve a problem on the level on
which it was created". We clearly need to elevate our level of consciousness, and we are now presented with a unique opportunity
to do so.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that 2018 is the breakthrough year for the return of a world that works for everyone!</p>
