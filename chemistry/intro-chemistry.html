    <h1>Introduction to Chemistry</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a brief introduction to chemistry. It is like a summary, or "cheat sheet". It includes a small introduction
to organic chemistry.</p>

    <p>This summary is primarily based on the material in <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_Beginning_Chemistry_(Ball)">Beginning Chemistry</a>.</p>

    <p>It is handy to always have a browser tab open with the <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table" target="_blank">Periodic Table</a>.</p>

    <h2>Atoms</h2>

    <p><em>Matter</em> is anything that has mass and takes up space. A <em>substance</em> is matter that has the same physical
and chemical properties throughout.</p>

    <p>An <em>element</em> is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary
chemical means.</p>

    <p>The smallest piece of an element that maintains the identity of the element is called an <em>atom</em>. Hence all
matter is made from atoms.</p>

    <p>Each atom contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A compact <em>nucleus</em> containing:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Protons</em>. They are positively charged (1+), and weigh about 1.6e<sup>-27</sup> kg.</li>
          <li><em>Neutrons</em>. They are uncharged, and weigh about the same as protons (slightly more).</li>
        </ul>
      <li><em>Electrons</em>. They are negatively charged (1-), and weigh only about 9.1e<sup>-31</sup> kg.
These electrons circle around the nucleus at a relatively large distance from it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the atom is uncharged, it has the same number of protons as electrons.</p>

    <h2>Periodic Table</h2>

    <p>All known elements occur in the <em>periodic table</em>, in a purposely chosen layout. For each element, the following
data (and more) is found in the periodic table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the element. E.g. Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon, Oxygen, Silver.</li>
      <li><em>Element symbol</em>. E.g. (corresponding with the names above) H, He, C, O, Ag.</li>
      <li><em>Atomic number</em>. This is the number of protons, and uniquely identifies the element.</li>
      <li>Key <em>isotopes</em>. While the number of protons is fixed, the number of neutrons can vary for one element,
thus leading to different isotopes. E.g. <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C.</li>
      <li><em>Atomic mass</em>. This is the (average) sum of the number of protons and neutrons. Given that there can be multiple
isotopes (some abundantly available, some rare), this is typically not a whole number, but it is a weighted average.</li>
      <li>Density, in g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>
      <li>Other physical properties like state at room temperature, melting point, boiling point.</li>
      <li>Uses and properties, history.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>An <em>atomic mass unit</em> (<em>u</em>) is approximately the mass of 1 proton or neutron. More precisely, an
atomic mass unit is one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, which is a carbon isotope having 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The
<em>mass number</em> of an isotope of an element is the exact number of protons plus the exact number of neutrons (which
clearly is a whole number for the isotope). Given that isotopes of an element occur in a given ratio, the <em>atomic mass</em>
of an element is the weighted average mass number for that element.</p>

    <p>There is more interesting data in the periodic table, but for that we need to know more about electron configurations.
In a quantum-mechanical model of an atom, the state of an electron is described by 4 <em>quantum numbers</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Principal quantum number</em>, or <em>n</em>. It identifies the <em>shell</em>, which can be thought of as the
distance to the nucleus. It is a non-zero whole number: 1, 2 or higher. The higher the number, the further the shell is from
the nucleus, and the more energy the electrons in that shell have.</li>
      <li><em>Angular momentum quantum number</em>, or <em>l</em>. It identifies the <em>subshell</em> within a shell.
It is any number between 0 and <em>n - 1</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Magnetic quantum number</em>, or <em>m<sub>l</sub></em>. It is any integer between <em>-l</em> and <em>l</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Spin quantum number</em>. It is either <em>1/2</em> or <em>-1/2</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <em>Pauli exclusion principle</em> states that no 2 electrons in an atom can have the same set of 4 quantum numbers.
Keep that in mind below, when talking about electron configurations. Note that for subshell <em>l</em> (in a given shell)
there can be <code>2 * l + 1</code> different magnetic quantum numbers, so <code> 2 * (2 * l + 1)</code> electrons
(taking the 2 different spin quantum numbers in mind).</p>

    <p>The quantum numbers lead to the <em>electron configuration</em> of an element in the periodic table. First give the
subshells a letter instead of number, namely <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em> and <em>f</em> for subshell 0, 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Remember this as <em>SPeeD, Fine</em>, for example. The electron configuration repeats the pattern
shell-subshell-(electron-count). For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>1s<sup>1</sup></em> for H. That is: shell 1, subshell s (or 0), and 1 electron in that subshell.</li>
      <li><em>1s<sup>2</sup></em> for He. That is: shell 1, subshell s (or 0), and 2 electrons in that subshell, which is the
maximum number of electrons in any <em>s</em> subshell.</li>
      <li><em>[He]2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup></em> for C. Note that [He] stands for <em>1s<sup>2</sup></em>, but there is no
need to repeat that (which will become clear later). Also note that for increasing atomic numbers first the lower level shells
are filled, roughly, and that per subshell the order is roughly s-p-d-f when "filling electrons".</li>
      <li><em>[Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>1</sup></em> for Au (gold). All subshells but the last are completely
filled.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that for uncharged atoms, the number of electrons and protons are the same, which makes sense because protons
and electrons have the opposite charge (1 and -1, respectively). Hence, the number of electrons is the same as the atomic
number. Note that the number of electrons also easily follows from the electron configuration.</p>

    <p>Also note that electrons start to fill the "lowest energy positions" that are not filled. This is clearly visible in the
periodic table, for increasing atomic numbers.</p>

    <p>The electron configuration of an element tells us a lot about reactivity. When shells and subshells are completely filled,
the atom is so stable that it hardly reacts, if at all. That's the case for <em>noble gases</em>, like He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe.
The <em>octet rule</em> says that atoms like to have 8 electrons in their valence shell. More about that (and exceptions)
later.</p>

    <p>For each element, the highest numbered shell is called the <em>valence shell</em>. The electrons in the valence shell,
plus the electrons in the last unfilled subshell are called <em>valence electrons</em> (but beware of double counting). Elements
with similar electron configuration in their valence shells have similar chemistry. This is represented in the periodic table
by elements having the same column. For example, the noble gases all have fully filled shells and subshells, and they are all
found in the rightmost column.</p>

    <p>One trend in the periodic table is that the <em>atomic radius</em> goes up if we go down in one column (group), but
goes down if we go to the right in one row (period). The reasons are: going down in one group means an extra shell, increasing
the atomic radius, but going to the right in one period means more protons and therefore more positive charge attracting
the valence electrons.</p>

    <p>The <em>ionization energy</em> is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom in the gas phase.
Going down in the periodic table means decreasing ionization energy, because the valence electron is further away from the
nucleus, due to it being in a higher numbered shell. Going to the right in the periodic table means increasing ionization
energy, due to the increasing pull on the electrons by the increasing number of protons.</p>

    <p>There is more than one IE (ionization energy), for removing successive electrons (if the atom has them).
These successive IE's increase, due to the larger net positive charge.</p>

    <p>The opposite of IE is <em>electron affinity</em> (EA). That is the energy change when a gas-phase atom accepts an
electron. The general trend (in kJ/mol) is obvious, but there is no definitive trend.</p>

    <p><em>Electronegativity</em> is a qualitative scale for judging how much an atom of a given element attracts electrons to
itself in a chemical bond. Electronegativity (Pauling scale) is the highest for fluorine, that is the top right corner of the
periodic table with the exception of the noble gas group (at the last column). It is the lowest at the botton left corner.
Obviously, due to the octet rule, halogens (in the column directly left of the noble gases) have high electronegativity.
These elements "want to attract" an electron to fully fill their valence shell with 8 instead of 7 electrons. Indeed,
going from left to right in the periodic table tends to increase the electronegativity. In left columns, the metals there
want to shed electrons rather than attract them, according to the octet rule. When going down, electronegativity decreases,
which makes sense in that valence electrons are further away from the positively charged nucleus.</p>

    <p>Strictly, electronegativity is a property of an atom within a molecule, rather than an inherent property of an atom.</p>

    <h3>Types of elements</h3>

    <p>There are different groups of elements in the periodic table. Most elements are <em>metals</em>. Subgroups are
alkali metals, alkaline earths and transition metals, for example. Most metals are solid, shiny, with high density and with
high melting points. Mercury (Hg) is liquid at room temperature, however. Most metals have valence electrons that are easily
removed, so electronegativity is low. Most metals conduct heat and electricity well.</p>

    <p><em>Nonmetals</em> other than H occur on the upper right side of the periodic table. They have high electronegativity. They
poorly conduct heat and electricity. If solid, they are typically brittle. Two subtypes stand out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Noble gases</em> (or: inert gases). They are gases at room temperature. They are the rightmost group in the
periodic table. They have a complete valence shell, and are therefore relatively unreactive.</li>
      <li><em>Halogens</em>. They have very high electronegativity, and have 7 valence electrons. They are the rightmost group
left of the noble gases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Another group of nonmetals is <em>semimetals</em> (or: <em>metalloids</em>). They are in between metals and nonmetals
in the periodic table, and therefore also in electronegativity, ionization energy etc. Reactivity typically depends on the
element with which they react.</p>

    <h2>Molecules, Ions and Ionic Compounds</h2>

    <p>A <em>molecule</em> is the smallest part of a substance that has the physical and chemical properties of that substance.
They combine atoms in whole-number ratios. Molecules have no charge, and their atoms are bound by <em>covalent</em> bonds.
That is, their atoms <em>share electrons</em>, instead of one atom stealing the other atom's electrons (which would instead
lead to ionic compounds).</p>

    <p>There are 2 kinds of molecules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Single-element molecules</em>, or element molecules, or molecular elements.</li>
      <li><em>Molecular compounds</em> (being compounds implies that more than 1 element is involved).
More precisely, a molecular compound combines 2 or more nonmetals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some elements exist naturally as molecules (2-atom or having more than 2 atoms), for example H<sub>2</sub>,
O<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>4</sub> and S<sub>8</sub>.</p>

    <p>Molecules (with a given <em>molecular formula</em>) have a <em>molecular mass</em> which trivially follows from the
<em>atomic mass</em> of the elements in the formula and their quantities in the formula.</p>

    <p>A <em>compound</em> combines at least 2 different elements. There are 2 types of compounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Molecular compound</em>. See above. It is a molecule that combines at least 2 different elements.</li>
      <li><em>Ionic compound</em>. It is a compound that formed from positive and negative <em>ions</em>. Hence, ionic
compounds do not covalently bind atoms (electron sharing), but bind (charged) ions (<em>ionic binding</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Ions</em> are either <em>cations</em> (positively charged, more protons than electrons) or <em>anions</em> (negatively
charged, more electrons than protons). Ions form by atoms gaining or losing electrons.</p>

    <p>Ignoring the charge (positive or negative), there are 2 types of ions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Monatomic ion</em>. Monatomic cations are hydrogen and metals. Monatomic anions are nonmetals (other than H).</li>
      <li><em>Polyatomic ion</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The periodic table helps a lot in understanding ionic compounds. Take for example table salt. It combines Na<sup>+</sup>
and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, through ionic binding. Table salt disassociates in water, breaking it down into its component
ions. The periodic table shows that sodium "wants to be" the Na<sup>+</sup> ion and chlorium "wants to be" the Cl<sup>-</sup>
ion. After all, given the <em>octet rule</em> and the fact that sodium has one valence electron, it "wants to get rid of" this
single electron, giving the resulting ion more of the stability of the neon noble gas. Likewise, chlorium has 7 valence electrons,
so it is "more than willing" to receive that extra electron. Similar remarks apply to other element pairs in the same columns
in the periodic table, one being a metal and the other one being a nonmetal. So, from the periodic table and the octet rule
it is easy to see that sodium ions have charge 1+ (Na<sup>+</sup>), magnesium ions have charge 2+ (Mg<sup>2+</sup>),
chloride ions have charge 1- (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and sulfide ions have charge 2- (S<sup>2-</sup>).</p>

    <p>Electronegativity helps in understanding covalent bonds (molecules) vs. ionic bonds. The difference in electronegativity
between atoms determines the kind of bond. If this difference is less than 2, the bond is <em>covalent</em>. A difference still
makes the molecule <em>polar</em>, where part of the molecule is positively charged, and part of the molecule is negatively
charged. If this difference is greater than 2, as is the case between metals and nonmetals, the bond between the atoms
is <em>ionic</em>. Recall that in covalent bonds, electrons are shared, whereas in ionic bonds, electrons move from one
atom to the other, thus leading to a bond between ions. Organic compounds (having elements such as C, H, O, N etc.) tend to
be molecular, due to the electronegativity differences between them being smaller than 2. Note that the difference in
electronegativity between F and H is almost 2, so a covalent binding between the 2 elements is highly polar.</p>

    <p>Many compounds exist as molecules. Especially, when nonmetals connect with other nonmetals, the resulting compounds
are molecules. <em>Binary molecular compounds</em> are named as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use prefixes before the 2 element names (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, deca-) before the element name, but leave out "mono-" before the first element.</li>
      <li>Change the 2nd element name: chlorine becomes chloride, oxygen becomes oxide, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Take for example the substance with <em>molecular formula</em> SO<sub>2</sub> (recall that the elements in the molecular
compound occur in whole-number ratios, and 1 is implicit and can therefore be left out in the formula). This substance is called
sulfur dioxide. Not surprisingly, SO<sub>3</sub> is called sulfur trioxide. Sometimes we use common names instead, like water
for H<sub>2</sub>O, ammonia for NH<sub>3</sub> and methane for CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>

    <p>Naming monatomic ions is simple. The cations are simply named as the element (possibly adding the word ion), whereas
the anions change names (similarly to binary molecular compounds): chlorine becomes the chloride ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and
nitrogen becomes the nitride ion (N<sup>3-</sup>). If an element has more than one possible charge, this charge becomes part
of the name. For example: Fe<sup>2+</sup> is the iron(II) cation, and Fe<sup>3+</sup> is the iron(III) cation.</p>

    <p>Chemical formulas for ionic compounds are called <em>ionic formulas</em>. Like molecular formulas, they show the numbers
of atoms of the different elements in the formula. Unlike molecular formulas, ionic formulas have a cation and anion, and the net
charge must be 0. For example, take the ionic compound between Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. To balance the
charges, the number of chloride ions must be twice the number of magnesium ions, and the ionic formula is MgCl<sub>2</sub>.
Note that the charges of the ions are implicit and not visible in the ionic formula.</p>

    <p>Naming ionic compounds is simple. Combine the names of the ions (leaving out the word "ion"). If the cations can have
more than one charge (like iron cations), the charge becomes part of the name of the ionic compound. For example, FeS is
iron(II) sulfide (and indeed sulfide has charge 2-), and Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> is iron(III) sulfide (where again
sulfide has charge 2- per ion). So the charge can be part of the name of the ionic compound, whereas it is implicit in the
ionic formula.</p>

    <p>If molecular formulas and ionic formulas look so much alike, how can we tell them apart? Molecular compounds form
between nonmetals and nonmetals, whereas ionic compounds form between metals and nonmetals.</p>

    <p>Some well-known polyatomic ions are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ammonium: NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup></li>
      <li>Acetate: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Bicarbonate (hydrogen carbonate): HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Bisulfate (hydrogen sulfate): HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Carbonate: CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Chlorate: ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Chromate: CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Cyanide: CN<sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Dichromate: Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Hydroxide: OH<sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Nitrate: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Nitrite: NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Peroxide: O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Perchlorate: ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Phosphate: PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup></li>
      <li>Sulfate: SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Sufite: SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Triiodide: I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ionic formulas involving polyatomic ions typically need parentheses. For example, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
for calcium nitrate, which combines calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and nitrate ions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>).</p>

    <p><em>Acids</em> are an interesting group of compounds. Initially, they are defined as ionic compounds of the H<sup>+</sup>
cation dissolved in water. Acids have their own naming scheme. For example, HCl(aq) is called hydrochloric acid, and
H<sub>2</sub>S(aq) is called hydrosulfuric acid. If the anion is polyatomic, we get names like acetic acid
(HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq)), chloric acid (HClO<sub>3</sub>(aq)), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq))
and nitrous acid (HNO<sub>2</sub>(aq)).</p>

    <h2>Reactions and Equations</h2>

    <p>A concise representation of a <em>chemical reaction</em> is its <em>chemical equation</em>. The initial substances
are the <em>reactants</em> and the final substances are the <em>products</em>. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &#10230; 2 H<sub>2</sub>O</code>

    <p>This equation is <em>balanced</em>, as it must be. That means that it has the same numbers of atoms (for the different
elements involved) left and right of the arrow. In other words, the <em>law of conservation of matter</em> has been
satisfied.</p>

    <p>A more complex chemical equation would be:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>(s) &#10230; Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</code>

    <p>A <em>single-replacement reaction</em> substitutes one element for another one in a compound. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 HCl(aq) + Zn(s) &#10230; ZnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</code>
    <p>or:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 NaCl(aq) + F<sub>2</sub>(g) &#10230; 2 NaF(s) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g)</code>

    <p>The periodic table helps understand which single-replacement reactions involving halogens will occur and which ones
will not occur. Elements higher in the halogen column of the periodic table will replace ones lower in the column, but not
the other way around. The elements higher in the halogen column have more <em>electronegativity</em>, so attract the
electrons of a bond to a larger extent than elements lower in the halogen column do.</p>

    <p>A <em>double-replacement reaction</em> exchanges parts of 2 ionic compounds. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">CuCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 AgNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) &#10230; Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 AgCl(s)</code>

    <p>One type of double-replacement reaction is predictable, namely the <em>precipitation reaction</em>, leaving a solid
<em>precipitate</em>. To predict whether some precipitation reaction occurs, the <em>solubility rules</em> are of help. Whatever
does not dissolve can be a solid precipitate, and therefore one of the products in a double-replacement reaction.</p>

    <p>For the solubility rules, see <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_Beginning_Chemistry_(Ball)/04%3A_Chemical_Reactions_and_Equations/4.2%3A_Types_of_Chemical_Reactions_-_Single_and_Double_Replacement_Reactions" target="_blank">solubility rules</a>.

    <p>When molecular compounds dissolve in water, the individual molecules drift apart from each other. Yet when ionic
compounds dissolve, the <em>ions</em> physically separate from each other (<em>dissociation</em>). For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">NaCl(s) &#10230; Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</code>
    <p>or:</p>
    <code class="ce">CaCl<sub>2</sub>(s) &#10230; Ca<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2 Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</code>
    <p>Similar remarks apply when polyatomic ions are involved.</p>

    <p>When chemicals in a solution react (dissolved ionic compounds), it is therefore most appropriate to write a <em>complete
ionic equation</em>, where dissolved ionic compounds are written as separate ions. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq) + Ag<sup>+</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> &#10230;
AgCl(s) + Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(aq)</code>

    <p>The so-called <em>spectator ions</em> (that are the same on both sides of the equation) can be left out, leaving the
<em>net ionic equation</em>:</p>
    <code class="ce">Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq) + Ag<sup>+</sup> &#10230; AgCl(s)</code>

    <p>A <em>composition reaction</em> (or combination reaction, or synthesis reaction) produces a single substance from
multiple reactants. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub> &#10230; 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</code>

    <p>A <em>decomposition reaction</em> starts from a single substance and produces more than one substance. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>(s) &#10230; Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</code>

    <p>In a <em>combustion reaction</em> a reactant combines with oxygen, producing oxides as products. Any nitrogen in the
reactant converts to elemental nitrogen. Many reactants, called <em>fuels</em>, containing mostly carbon and hydrogen atoms,
produce CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the combustion reacion. Examples of combustion reactions:</p>
    <code class="ce">
    CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 O<sub>2</sub> &#10230; CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
    </code>
    <br/>

    <p>An <em>Arrhenius definition</em> of an <em>acid</em> or of a <em>base</em> is as follows: an <em>acid</em> is any
compound that increases the amount of hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) in an aqueous solution. Example: HCl. A <em>base</em>
is any compound that increases the amount of hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>) in an aqueous solution. A base is the chemical
opposite of an acid. Note that H<sup>+</sup> is a proton, but if a hydrogen ion is attached to water molecules, we would
represent this as a <em>hydronium ion</em> (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>).</p>

    <p>A reaction of an acid and a base is called a <em>neutralization reaction</em>. The reactants are the acid and base,
and the products are water and a salt. A <em>salt</em> is any ionic compound (whether soluble or insoluble) that is formed from
a reaction between an acid and a base. Example neutralization reaction (where the salt is MgCl<sub>2</sub>):</p>
    <code class="ce">2 HCl(aq) + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq) &#10230; 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + MgCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)</code>
    <p>Of course, we could instead have written the complete or net ionic reaction.</p>

    <p>TODO Oxidation-reduction reaction, or <em>redox reaction</em>. It involves the transfer of electrons.</p>

    <h3>Stoichiometry</h3>

    <p><em>Stoichiometry</em> is about relating one chemical substance to another using a balanced chemical reaction.</p>

    <p>A <em>mole</em> is a number of "things" (without unit) just like a dozen is 12 "things". A mole stands for
<code>6.02214179 * 10<sup>23</sup></code>. This number is known as <em>Avogadro's number</em> or <em>Avogadro's constant</em>.
This number is equal to the number of atoms in exactly <code>12 g</code> of carbon-12. In other words, it is about
the same as <code>1 g</code> of protons or neutrons. Put differently, <em>a mole of a substance has the same mass in grams as
one unit (atom or molecules) has in atomic mass units</em>. Moles let us express amounts of atoms and molecules in visible
amounts that we can understand. In a chemical equation, we can interpret any amount of reactant or product in terms of
moles. That is, chemical equations are also balanced in terms of moles. After all, in a balanced equation we can multiply
each amount of reactants/products with one and the same factor and the result would still be a balanced equation.</p>

    <h2>Lewis Electron Dot Diagrams</h2>

    <p>A <em>Lewis electron dot diagram</em> (or: Lewis diagram) represents <em>valence electrons</em> as dots around the
symbol of the element. Per side, there can be no more than 2 dots (which means indeed that there can be no more than 8
valence electrons per atom). Note that Lewis diagrams must correspond to the electron configuration, ignoring all electrons other
than the valence electrons.</p>

    <p>In <em>Lewis diagrams for monatomic ions</em> we simply add electrons (for anions) or remove electrons (for cations)
in the diagram. When representing <em>cations</em>, electrons are first lost from the <em>highest numbered shell</em>, not
necessarily the last subshell filled. That's the case in the electron configuration, and in the corresponding Lewis diagram.</p>

    <p>Recall the <em>octet rule</em>, stating that atoms like to have <em>8 electrons</em> in their <em>valence shell</em>.
Having 8 electrons in the valence shell is an energetically stable arrangement of electrons.</p>

    <p>The octet rule can be violated. Sodium in its elemental form is stable, in spite of it having 1 valence electron.
On the other hand, sodium reacts easily, and removing that 1 valence electron only takes little energy, making the Na<sup>+</sup>
cation. Removing one more electron takes more energy than available to most reactions, however, so in this case the octet rule
holds. When a sodium atom meets a chlorine atom, the sodium atom loses its single valence electron to the chlorine atom.
Both atoms, that thus became ions, "benefit", in that both ions obey the octet rule. These ions that have opposite charge
do attract each other, leading to an <em>ionic bond</em> between them.</p>

    <p>How strong is an ionic bond? That depends on the magnitude of the charges and the size of the ion. The greater the
magnitude of the charge, the stronger the ionic bond. The smaller the ion, the stronger the ionic bond.</p>

    <p>In a <em>covalent bond</em> there is no transfer of electrons, but <em>sharing</em> of electrons instead.
Shared electrons also count as valence shell electrons, for both atoms involved in the bond. In a Lewis diagram, it is common
to replace the 2 dots of shared electrons by a dash.</p>

    <p>Hydrogen is one of the diatomic elements. It makes sense that it is, because hydrogen (when sharing electrons)
can have at most 2 electrons in its <em>s</em> subshell. This sharing of 1 pair of electrons is called a <em>single bond</em>.
While hydrogen cannot obey the octet rule (it can at best fill the <em>s</em> subshell, by sharing another electron), fluorine can.
Fluorine is also diatomic, but when forming the diatomic molecule, both atoms have a complete octet of electrons, even if both
shared electrons are counted twice, once per atom.</p>

    <p>In a covalent bond, there are <em>bonding electron pairs</em> and <em>lone pair electrons</em>. It is the bonding
electron pairs that make the covalent bond. In a Lewis diagram, the bonding electron pairs would typically be drawn as dashes.
Each dash is a pair of electrons.</p>

    <p>How can we determine a <em>Lewis diagram</em> of a <em>simple molecule</em>? The following steps can be followed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Determine which is the <em>central atom</em> and which are the <em>surrounding atoms</em>.</li>
      <li>Count the total <em>number of valence electrons</em>, increasing the count for negative charges and decreasing the
count for positive charges.</li>
      <li>Write the central atom and surround it with the surrounding atoms.</li>
      <li>Put a pair of electrons between the central atom and each surrounding atom.</li>
      <li>Complete the octets around the surrounding atoms (except for hydrogen).</li>
      <li>Put remaining electrons, if any, around the central atom.</li>
      <li>Check that each atom has a <em>full valence shell</em>.</li>
      <li>If that is not the case, try moving electrons by making <em>double bonds</em> etc., and check again for full valence
shells.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If a covalent bond is <em>polar</em>, the Lewis diagram can represent that by using "dashes that are much thicker
at one end than at the other end". Recall the electronegativity difference scale from nonpolar covalent via polar covalent
to ionic. That is, from nonpolar electron sharing via polar electron sharing to electron transfer.</p>

    <p>The approximate amount of energy needed to break a covalent bond is called the <em>bond energy</em> of that bond.
<em>Breaking a covalent bond</em> is always <em>endothermic</em>, whereas <em>making a bond</em> is always <em>exothermic</em>.</p>

    <p>The 3 major types of violations against the octet rule are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Odd-electron molecules</em>, such as NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and ClO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
      <li><em>Electron-deficient molecules</em>. Examples: molecules containing beryllium or boron atoms.</li>
      <li><em>Expanded valence shell molecules</em>, having more than 8 electrons in the valence shell. For example
PF<sub>5</sub>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So far molecules were regarded as 2-dimensional constructs. They do have shapes, however, which follows from observed
physical properties and chemical behavior. The basis of molecular shapes is <em>VSEPR</em> which stands for
<em>valence shell electron pair repulsion</em>. This is not further explained here.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Organic Chemistry</h2>

    <p><em>Organic chemistry</em> is about studying <em>organic compounds</em>, which are molecules containing <em>carbon</em>.
That is, they are compounds containing carbon in covalent binding.</p>

    <p>The simplest organic compounds contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen. They are called <em>hydrocarbons</em>.
There are 2 main types of hydrocarbons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Aliphatic hydrocarbons</em>. They are hydrocarbons based on chains of carbon atoms.</li>
      <li><em>Aromatic hydrocarbons</em>. They have a special 6-carbon ring, called a <em>benzene ring</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Aliphatic hydrocarbons mainly come in 3 types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Alkanes</em>, which have only single covalent bonds.</li>
      <li><em>Alkenes</em>, which have at least one C-C double bond.</li>
      <li><em>Alkynes</em>, which have at least one C-C triple bond.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The occasional aliphatic hydrocarbons with a ring of C atoms are called <em>cycloalkanes/cycloalkenes/cycloalkynes</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Normal alkanes</em> are the simplest alkanes, having their C atoms bonded in a straight chain. They are named after
the number of C atoms, starting with methane, which is a molecule with formula CH<sub>4</sub>. With increasing numbers of C atoms
we get the following names (for normal alkanes):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Methane</em></li>
      <li><em>Ethane</em></li>
      <li><em>Propane</em></li>
      <li><em>Butane</em></li>
      <li><em>Pentane</em></li>
      <li><em>Hexane</em></li>
      <li><em>Heptane</em></li>
      <li><em>Octane</em></li>
      <li><em>Nonane</em></li>
      <li><em>Decane</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These normal alkanes all obey the formula template CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>
(where n can be 0), except for methane (which is simply CH<sub>4</sub>).</p>

    <p>Alkanes are also called <em>saturated hydrocarbons</em>, because they have the maximum number of H atoms possible
according to the rules of covalent bonds.</p>

    <p>Alkenes have a C-C double bond, so they are examples of <em>unsaturated hydrocarbons</em>.</p>

    <p>Alkenes have names that are similar to alkane names: ethene, propene, butene, pentene etc. Yet how do we express in
the name where the double C-C bond is located? That is done by adding a number to the name, e.g. 1-butene and 2-butene.
Note that 1-butene and 2-butene have the same <em>molecular formula</em>, namely C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, yet they
have different physical and chemical properties. Such different molecules having the same molecular formula are called
<em>isomers</em>.</p>

    <p>Naming for alkynes is quite similar to naming for alkenes, e.g. 1-butyne and 2-butyne.</p>

    <p>Aromatic compounds contain the <em>benzene</em> unit. It is a ring of 6 C atoms, with alternating single and double
(covalent) C-C bonds. The molecular formula of benzene is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.</p>

    <p>Most hydrocarbons are nonpolar because of the close electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen. They dissolve only
sparingly in polar solvents such as water. They are also rather unreactive. They do react with halogens. For example:</p>
    <code class="ce">CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> &#10230; CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl</code>
    <p>Example of an <em>addition reaction</em>:</p>
    <code class="ce">(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> &#10230; (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub></code>
    <p>Example of a <em>hydrogenation reaction</em>:</p>
    <code class="ce">(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> &#10230; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub></code>
    <p>Example of a <em>combustion reaction</em>:</p>
    <code class="ce">2 C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + 25 O<sub>2</sub> &#10230; 16 CO<sub>2</sub> + 18 H<sub>2</sub>O</code>

    <p>Some hydrocarbons are not straight chains, but are branched. They could still be isomers of straight-chain alkanes, but they
do have different chemical and physical properties. They are called <em>branched hydrocarbons</em>. Now do we name them?</p>

    <p>Let's first discuss naming for the branches, the <em>substituents</em>. If they are like alkanes, but minus one
hydrogen atom, they are called <em>alkyl groups</em>. For example, "methyl-" for methane minus one hydrogen atom,
"ethyl-" for ethane minus one hydrogen atom, "propyl-" for propane minus one hydrogen atom, etc. These substituents can
substitute individual hydrogen atoms in alkanes, for example.</p>

    <p>Consider a molecule which is a hexane, except that it has a branch from the 2nd carbon atom, where the branch
replaces the hydrogen atom by a methyl group. Then the name would be 2-methylhexane.</p>

    <p>There can be more than 1 branch, though. Take a pentane where the 2nd carbon atom binds to a methyl group and the
3rd carbon atom binds to an ethyl group. This molecule would then be named 3-ethyl-2-methylpentane. Note the alphabetical
order of alkyl groups in the name.</p>

    <p>Possibly the same alkyl group occurs more than once. Then we need prefixes like "di-", "tri-", "tetra-", "penta-".
If there are methyl groups binding to the 2nd and 3rd carbon atom in a butane, we get a 2,3-dimethylbutane.
A somewhat more complex branched alkane is 3-ethyl-2,2-dimethylheptane.</p>

    <p>For branched alkenes and alkynes a similar naming scheme is used. For example, 2,4-dimethyl-3-heptene.</p>

    <p>Naming branched benzene molecules is relatively simple. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Chlorobenzene</em>, if one H atom has been replaced by a Cl atom in the benzene ring.</li>
      <li><em>Ethylbenzene</em>, if one H atom has been replace by an ethyl group in the benzene ring.</li>
      <li>1,3-dichlorobenzene, if 2 H atoms have been replaced by Cl atoms.</li>
      <li>1-bromo-2-ethylbenzene, which is like ethylbenzene, but replacing another H atom by a Br atom.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If a benzene ring is considered the substituent in an aliphatic carbohydron, this ring is called <em>phenyl-</em>.
For example, 3-phenylpentane.</p>
