    <h1>Introduction to Chemistry</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a brief introduction to chemistry. It is like a summary, or "cheat sheet". It includes a small introduction
to organic chemistry.</p>

    <p>This summary is primarily based on the material in <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_Beginning_Chemistry_(Ball)">Beginning Chemistry</a>.</p>

    <p>It is handy to always have a browser tab open with the <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table" target="_blank">Periodic Table</a>.</p>

    <h2>Atoms</h2>

    <p><em>Matter</em> is anything that has mass and takes up space. A <em>substance</em> is matter that has the same physical
and chemical properties throughout.</p>

    <p>An <em>element</em> is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary
chemical means.</p>

    <p>The smallest piece of an element that maintains the identity of the element is called an <em>atom</em>. Hence all
matter is made from atoms.</p>

    <p>Each atom contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A compact <em>nucleus</em> containing:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Protons</em>. They are positively charged (1+), and weigh about 1.6e<sup>-27</sup> kg.</li>
          <li><em>Neutrons</em>. They are uncharged, and weigh about the same as protons (slightly more).</li>
        </ul>
      <li><em>Electrons</em>. They are negatively charged (1-), and weigh only about 9.1e<sup>-31</sup> kg.
These electrons circle around the nucleus at a relatively large distance from it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the atom is uncharged, it has the same number of protons as electrons.</p>

    <h2>Periodic Table</h2>

    <p>All known elements occur in the <em>periodic table</em>, in a purposely chosen layout. For each element, the following
data (and more) is found in the periodic table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the element. E.g. Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon, Oxygen, Silver.</li>
      <li><em>Element symbol</em>. E.g. (corresponding with the names above) H, He, C, O, Ag.</li>
      <li><em>Atomic number</em>. This is the number of protons, and uniquely identifies the element.</li>
      <li>Key <em>isotopes</em>. While the number of protons is fixed, the number of neutrons can vary for one element,
thus leading to different isotopes. E.g. <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C.</li>
      <li><em>Atomic mass</em>. This is the (average) sum of the number of protons and neutrons. Given that there can be multiple
isotopes (some abundantly available, some rare), this is typically not a whole number, but it is a weighted average.</li>
      <li>Density, in g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>
      <li>Other physical properties like state at room temperature, melting point, boiling point.</li>
      <li>Uses and properties, history.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>An <em>atomic mass unit</em> (<em>u</em>) is approximately the mass of 1 proton or neutron. More precisely, an
atomic mass unit is one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, which is a carbon isotope having 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The
<em>mass number</em> of an isotope of an element is the exact number of protons plus the exact number of neutrons (which
clearly is a whole number for the isotope). Given that isotopes of an element occur in a given ratio, the <em>atomic mass</em>
of an element is the weighted average mass number for that element.</p>

    <p>There is more interesting data in the periodic table, but for that we need to know more about electron configurations.
In a quantum-mechanical model of an atom, the state of an electron is described by 4 <em>quantum numbers</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Principal quantum number</em>, or <em>n</em>. It identifies the <em>shell</em>, which can be thought of as the
distance to the nucleus. It is a non-zero whole number: 1, 2 or higher. The higher the number, the further the shell is from
the nucleus, and the more energy the electrons in that shell have.</li>
      <li><em>Angular momentum quantum number</em>, or <em>l</em>. It identifies the <em>subshell</em> within a shell.
It is any number between 0 and <em>n - 1</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Magnetic quantum number</em>, or <em>m<sub>l</sub></em>. It is any integer between <em>-l</em> and <em>l</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Spin quantum number</em>. It is either <em>1/2</em> or <em>-1/2</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <em>Pauli exclusion principle</em> states that no 2 electrons in an atom can have the same set of 4 quantum numbers.
Keep that in mind below, when talking about electron configurations. Note that for subshell <em>l</em> (in a given shell)
there can be <code>2 * l + 1</code> different magnetic quantum numbers, so <code> 2 * (2 * l + 1)</code> electrons
(taking the 2 different spin quantum numbers in mind).</p>

    <p>The quantum numbers lead to the <em>electron configuration</em> of an element in the periodic table. First give the
subshells a letter instead of number, namely <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em> and <em>f</em> for subshell 0, 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Remember this as <em>SPeeD, Fine</em>, for example. The electron configuration repeats the pattern
shell-subshell-(electron-count). For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>1s<sup>1</sup></em> for H. That is: shell 1, subshell s (or 0), and 1 electron in that subshell.</li>
      <li><em>1s<sup>2</sup></em> for He. That is: shell 1, subshell s (or 0), and 2 electrons in that subshell, which is the
maximum number of electrons in any <em>s</em> subshell.</li>
      <li><em>[He]2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup></em> for C. Note that [He] stands for <em>1s<sup>2</sup></em>, but there is no
need to repeat that (which will become clear later). Also note that for increasing atomic numbers first the lower level shells
are filled, roughly, and that per subshell the order is roughly s-p-d-f when "filling electrons".</li>
      <li><em>[Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>1</sup></em> for Au (gold). All subshells but the last are completely
filled.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that for uncharged atoms, the number of electrons and protons are the same, which makes sense because protons
and electrons have the opposite charge (1 and -1, respectively). Hence, the number of electrons is the same as the atomic
number. Note that the number of electrons also easily follows from the electron configuration.</p>

    <p>Also note that electrons start to fill the "lowest energy positions" that are not filled. This is clearly visible in the
periodic table, for increasing atomic numbers.</p>

    <p>The electron configuration of an element tells us a lot about reactivity. When shells and subshells are completely filled,
the atom is so stable that it hardly reacts, if at all. That's the case for <em>noble gases</em>, like He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe.
The <em>octet rule</em> says that atoms like to have 8 electrons in their valence shell. More about that (and exceptions)
later.</p>

    <p>For each element, the highest numbered shell is called the <em>valence shell</em>. The electrons in the valence shell,
plus the electrons in the last unfilled subshell are called <em>valence electrons</em> (but beware of double counting). Elements
with similar electron configuration in their valence shells have similar chemistry. This is represented in the periodic table
by elements having the same column. For example, the noble gases all have fully filled shells and subshells, and they are all
found in the rightmost column.</p>

    <p>TODO Groups of elements (halogens, metals, noble gases, etc.)</p>

    <h2>Molecules, Ions and Ionic Compounds</h2>

    <p>A <em>molecule</em> is the smallest part of a substance that has the physical and chemical properties of that substance.
They combine atoms in whole-number ratios. Molecules have no charge, and their atoms are bound by <em>covalent</em> bonds.
That is, their atoms <em>share electrons</em>, instead of one atom stealing the other atom's electrons (which would instead
lead to ionic compounds).</p>

    <p>There are 2 kinds of molecules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Single-element molecules</em>, or element molecules, or molecular elements.</li>
      <li><em>Molecular compounds</em> (being compounds implies that more than 1 element is involved).
More precisely, a molecular compound combines 2 or more nonmetals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some elements exist naturally as molecules (2-atom or having more than 2 atoms), for example H<sub>2</sub>,
O<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>4</sub> and S<sub>8</sub>.</p>

    <p>Molecules (with a given <em>molecular formula</em>) have a <em>molecular mass</em> which trivially follows from the
<em>atomic mass</em> of the elements in the formula and their quantities in the formula.</p>

    <p>A <em>compound</em> combines at least 2 different elements. There are 2 types of compounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Molecular compound</em>. See above. It is a molecule that combines at least 2 different elements.</li>
      <li><em>Ionic compound</em>. It is a compound that formed from positive and negative <em>ions</em>. Hence, ionic
compounds do not covalently bind atoms (electron sharing), but bind (charged) ions (<em>ionic binding</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Ions</em> are either <em>cations</em> (positively charged, more protons than electrons) or <em>anions</em> (negatively
charged, more electrons than protons). Ions form by atoms gaining or losing electrons.</p>

    <p>Ignoring the charge (positive or negative), there are 2 types of ions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Monatomic ion</em>. Monatomic cations are hydrogen and metals. Monatomic anions are nonmetals (other than H).</li>
      <li><em>Polyatomic ion</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The periodic table helps a lot in understanding ionic compounds. Take for example table salt. It combines Na<sup>+</sup>
and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, through ionic binding. Table salt disassociates in water, breaking it down into its component
ions. The periodic table shows that sodium "wants to be" the Na<sup>+</sup> ion and chlorium "wants to be" the Cl<sup>-</sup>
ion. After all, given the <em>octet rule</em> and the fact that sodium has one valence electron, it "wants to get rid of" this
single electron, giving the resulting ion more of the stability of the neon noble gas. Likewise, chlorium has 7 valence electrons,
so it is "more than willing" to receive that extra electron. Similar remarks apply to other element pairs in the same columns
in the periodic table, one being a metal and the other one being a nonmetal. So, from the periodic table and the octet rule
it is easy to see that sodium ions have charge 1+ (Na<sup>+</sup>), magnesium ions have charge 2+ (Mg<sup>2+</sup>),
chloride ions have charge 1- (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and sulfide ions have charge 2- (S<sup>2-</sup>).</p>

    <p>Many compounds exist as molecules. Especially, when nonmetals connect with other nonmetals, the resulting compounds
are molecules. <em>Binary molecular compounds</em> are named as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use prefixes before the 2 element names (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, deca-) before the element name, but leave out "mono-" before the first element.</li>
      <li>Change the 2nd element name: chlorine becomes chloride, oxygen becomes oxide, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Take for example the substance with <em>molecular formula</em> SO<sub>2</sub> (recall that the elements in the molecular
compound occur in whole-number ratios, and 1 is implicit and can therefore be left out in the formula). This substance is called
sulfur dioxide. Not surprisingly, SO<sub>3</sub> is called sulfur trioxide. Sometimes we use common names instead, like water
for H<sub>2</sub>O, ammonia for NH<sub>3</sub> and methane for CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>

    <p>Naming monatomic ions is simple. The cations are simply named as the element (possibly adding the word ion), whereas
the anions change names (similarly to binary molecular compounds): chlorine becomes the chloride ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and
nitrogen becomes the nitride ion (N<sup>3-</sup>). If an element has more than one possible charge, this charge becomes part
of the name. For example: Fe<sup>2+</sup> is the iron(II) cation, and Fe<sup>3+</sup> is the iron(III) cation.</p>

    <p>Chemical formulas for ionic compounds are called <em>ionic formulas</em>. Like molecular formulas, they show the numbers
of atoms of the different elements in the formula. Unlike molecular formulas, ionic formulas have a cation and anion, and the net
charge must be 0. For example, take the ionic compound between Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. To balance the
charges, the number of chloride ions must be twice the number of magnesium ions, and the ionic formula is MgCl<sub>2</sub>.
Note that the charges of the ions are implicit and not visible in the ionic formula.</p>

    <p>Naming ionic compounds is simple. Combine the names of the ions (leaving out the word "ion"). If the cations can have
more than one charge (like iron cations), the charge becomes part of the name of the ionic compound. For example, FeS is
iron(II) sulfide (and indeed sulfide has charge 2-), and Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> is iron(III) sulfide (where again
sulfide has charge 2- per ion). So the charge can be part of the name of the ionic compound, whereas it is implicit in the
ionic formula.</p>

    <p>If molecular formulas and ionic formulas look so much alike, how can we tell them apart? Molecular compounds form
between nonmetals and nonmetals, whereas ionic compounds form between metals and nonmetals.</p>

    <p>Some well-known polyatomic ions are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ammonium: NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup></li>
      <li>Acetate: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Bicarbonate (hydrogen carbonate): HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Bisulfate (hydrogen sulfate): HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Carbonate: CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Chlorate: ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Chromate: CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Cyanide: CN<sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Dichromate: Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Hydroxide: OH<sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Nitrate: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Nitrite: NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Peroxide: O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Perchlorate: ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
      <li>Phosphate: PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup></li>
      <li>Sulfate: SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Sufite: SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></li>
      <li>Triiodide: I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ionic formulas involving polyatomic ions typically need parentheses. For example, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
for calcium nitrate, which combines calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and nitrate ions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>).</p>

    <p><em>Acids</em> are an interesting group of compounds. Initially, they are defined as ionic compounds of the H<sup>+</sup>
cation dissolved in water. Acids have their own naming scheme. For example, HCl(aq) is called hydrochloric acid, and
H<sub>2</sub>S(aq) is called hydrosulfuric acid. If the anion is polyatomic, we get names like acetic acid
(HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq)), chloric acid (HClO<sub>3</sub>(aq)), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq))
and nitrous acid (HNO<sub>2</sub>(aq)).</p>

    <h2>Reactions and Equations</h2>

    <p>A concise representation of a <em>chemical reaction</em> is its <em>chemical equation</em>. The initial substances
are the <em>reactants</em> and the final substances are the <em>products</em>. For example:</p>
    <code>2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &#8594; 2 H<sub>2</sub>O</code>

    <p>This equation is <em>balanced</em>, as it must be. That means that it has the same numbers of atoms (for the different
elements involved) left and right of the arrow. In other words, the <em>law of conservation of matter</em> has been
satisfied.</p>

    <p>A more complex chemical equation would be:</p>
    <code>2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>(s) &#8594; Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</code>

    <p>A <em>single-replacement reaction</em> substitutes one element for another one in a compound. For example:</p>
    <code>2 HCl(aq) + Zn(s) &#8594; ZnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</code>

    <p>The periodic table helps understand which single-replacement reactions involving halogens will occur and which ones
will not occur. Elements higher in the halogen column of the periodic table will replace ones lower in the column, but not
the other way around. The elements higher in the halogen column have more <em>electronegativity</em>, so attract the
electrons of a bond to a larger extent than elements lower in the halogen column do.</p>

    <p>A <em>double-replacement reaction</em> exchanges parts of 2 ionic compounds. For example:</p>
    <code>CuCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 AgNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) &#8594; Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 AgCl(s)</code>

    <p>To predict whether some double-replacement reaction occurs, the <em>solubility rules</em> are of help. Whatever does
not dissolve can be a precipitate, and therefore be a product in a double-replacement reaction.</p>

    <p>For the solubility rules, see <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_Beginning_Chemistry_(Ball)/04%3A_Chemical_Reactions_and_Equations/4.2%3A_Types_of_Chemical_Reactions_-_Single_and_Double_Replacement_Reactions" target="_blank">solubility rules</a>.</p>
