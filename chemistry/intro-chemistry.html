    <h1>Introduction to Chemistry</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a brief introduction to chemistry. It is like a summary, or "cheat sheet". It includes a small introduction
to organic chemistry.</p>

    <p>This summary is primarily based on the material in <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_Beginning_Chemistry_(Ball)">Beginning Chemistry</a>.</p>

    <p>It is handy to always have a browser tab open with the <a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table" target="_blank">Periodic Table</a>.</p>

    <h2>Atoms</h2>

    <p>An <em>element</em> is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary chemical
means.</p>

    <p>The smallest piece of an element that maintains the identity of the element is called an <em>atom</em>.</p>

    <p>Each atom contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A compact <em>nucleus</em> containing:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Protons</em>. They are positively charged (1+), and weigh about 1.6e<sup>-27</sup> kg.</li>
          <li><em>Neutrons</em>. They are uncharged, and weigh about the same as protons (slightly more).</li>
        </ul>
      <li><em>Electrons</em>. They are negatively charged (1-), and weigh only about 9.1e<sup>-31</sup> kg.
These electrons circle around the nucleus at a relatively large distance from it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the atom is uncharged, it has the same number of protons as electrons.</p>

    <h2>Periodic Table</h2>

    <p>All known elements occur in the <em>periodic table</em>, in a purposely chosen layout. For each element, the following
data (and more) is found in the periodic table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the element. E.g. Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon, Oxygen, Silver.</li>
      <li><em>Element symbol</em>. E.g. (corresponding with the names above) H, He, C, O, Ag.</li>
      <li><em>Atomic number</em>. This is the number of protons, and uniquely identifies the element.</li>
      <li>Key <em>isotopes</em>. While the number of protons is fixed, the number of neutrons can vary for one element,
thus leading to different isotopes. E.g. <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C.</li>
      <li><em>Mass number</em>. This is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons. Given that there can be multiple
isotopes (some abundantly available, some rare), this is typically not a whole number.</li>
      <li>Density, in g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>
      <li>Other physical properties like state at room temperature, melting point, boiling point.</li>
      <li>Uses and properties, history.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is more interesting data in the periodic table, but for that we need to know more about electron configurations.
In a quantum-mechanical model of an atom, the state of an electron is described by 4 <em>quantum numbers</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Principal quantum number</em>, or <em>n</em>. It identifies the <em>shell</em>, which can be thought of as the
distance to the nucleus. It is a non-zero whole number: 1, 2 or higher. The higher the number, the further the shell is from
the nucleus, and the more energy the electrons in that shell have.</li>
      <li><em>Angular momentum quantum number</em>, or <em>l</em>. It identifies the <em>subshell</em> within a shell.
It is any number between 0 and <em>n - 1</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Magnetic quantum number</em>, or <em>m<sub>l</sub></em>. It is any integer between <em>-l</em> and <em>l</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Spin quantum number</em>. It is either <em>1/2</em> or <em>-1/2</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <em>Pauli exclusion principle</em> states that no 2 electrons in an atom can have the same set of 4 quantum numbers.
Keep that in mind below, when talking about electron configurations.</p>

    <p>The quantum numbers lead to the <em>electron configuration</em> of an element in the periodic table. First give the
subshells a letter instead of number, namely <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em> and <em>f</em> for subshell 0, 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Remember this as <em>SPeeD, Fine</em>, for example. The electron configuration repeats the pattern
shell-subshell-(electron-count). For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>1s<sup>1</sup></em> for H. That is: shell 1, subshell s (or 0), and 1 electron in that subshell.</li>
      <li><em>1s<sup>2</sup></em> for He. That is: shell 1, subshell s (or 0), and 2 electrons in that subshell, which is the
maximum number of electrons in any <em>s</em> subshell.</li>
      <li><em>[He]2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup></em> for C. Note that [He] stands for <em>1s<sup>2</sup></em>, but there is no
need to repeat that (which will become clear later). Also note that for increasing atomic numbers first the lower level shells
are filled, roughly, and that per subshell the order is roughly s-p-d-f when "filling electrons".</li>
      <li><em>[Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>1</sup></em> for Au (gold). All subshells but the last are completely
filled.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The electron configuration of an element tells us a lot about reactivity. When shells and subshells are completely filled,
the atom is so stable that it hardly reacts, if at all. That's the case for <em>noble gases</em>, like He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe.
The <em>octet rule</em> says that atoms like to have 8 electrons in their valence shell. More about that (and exceptions)
later.</p>

    <p>For each element, the highest numbered shell is called the <em>valence shell</em>. The electrons in the valence shell,
plus the electrons in the last unfilled subshell are called <em>valence electrons</em>. Elements with similar electron
configuration in their valence shells have similar chemistry. This is represented in the periodic table by elements having the
same column. For example, the noble gases all have fully filled shells and subshells, and they are all found in the rightmost
column.</p>
