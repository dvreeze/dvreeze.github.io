<a name="jvm-experience" class="anchor" href="#jvm-experience"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Java/Scala experience</h3>

<p>My development experience for the most part concerns the Java platform. This started with many years of (enterprise) Java development. After that I spent many years on Scala development (mixed with some Java development).</p>

<p>As much as I like Scala programming because of Scala's expressiveness and non-intrusive compile-time type-safety, Java has certainly caught up (lambdas/streams, "var" keyword, record types, immutable Guava collections, "FP patterns" in modern libraries, etc.). Also, development opportunities in Scala are still less common than I would like. Both factors caused me to get a renewed interest in Java. Of course, there is still a lot of overlap between Java and Scala development, such as the runtime platform and much of the ecosystem and tooling, so Java and Scala skills in a way strengthen each other.</p>

<p>Besides "regular" application development I also authored several (open source) libraries, for XPath analysis, XML processing (called "yaidom") and XBRL processing. These libraries in turn enabled fast and safe application software development in their respective domains.</p>

<p>I am passionate about software quality, and in particular about the ability to reason (locally) about code without losing clarity and readability. I like mentoring less experienced developers and giving "tech presentations".</p>

<p>As an example, my "yaidom" presentation at XML London 2015 is <a href="xml-london-2015" target="_blank">XML processing with Scala and yaidom</a>.</p>

        <h3>
<a name="important-stuff" class="anchor" href="#important-stuff"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other important stuff</h3>

<p>Of course I'm not only a developer, but also a member of (Dutch) society. A critical one, I might add. It's April 2024 as I write this, and there's clearly a lot going on. To mention just a few things, from my perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a big push to go to war with Russia. As always, we are being lied to about the reasons for war. We are supposed to believe the official lie that it's about "us, the good guys, versus them, the barbarians". The compliant media don't tell us that "the West" has been pushing for war with Russia for decades, and that all peace initiatives have been blocked by "us". Of course this is a very dangerous game, with very few people at the top benefiting at the expense of everybody else. General Smedley Butler explained it well in his small book "War is a Racket". It's also very telling that the Russian perspective is censored in the West. Do we by any chance have anything to hide, like "us" being responsible for the deaths of so many Ukrainians (we call that "supporting Ukraine")? Personally I have been to Russia many times, and was always treated well. So nobody tells me that Russia is the enemy. If you strongly disagree with me about that, why don't you personally pay the price at the front instead of manipulating others to do the senseless dying for you?</li>
<li>A few years back a supposed Covid "health crisis" was in reality a largely successful experiment in government tyranny, in many countries around the world (but don't call it a conspiracy). Ridiculous measures were taken, such as curfews (after all, the virus strikes after nine in the evening), mask mandates (masks are unhealthy and do not stop infection), mandatory PCR testing (the inventor of the PCR method, Kary Mullis, made clear that his invention was unfit for use as a tool for diagnosing disease), mandatory Covid jabs (whereas the really safe and effective Zelenko protocol was not profitable enough and therefore banned), and QR codes to ban the Covid-unvaccinated from public life (where have we seen that before?). Physicians who were openly skeptical about the jabs were severely punished. Covid-unvaccinated "elites" threatened the Covid-unvaccinated "plebs" to get the jab, or else. Those damaged by the jab still get no recognition for their bad experience with the jab. The excess deaths started with the Covid vaccination campaigns, not before that. In short, this was never about health; it was about taking our freedoms away. We must never forget what happened, and we must never allow this to happen again.</li>
<li>If we are "the good guys", why is Julian Assange still locked up? His unforgivable crime: real and honest journalism, showing that the emperor has no clothes. Many other courageous truth tellers are locked up in the "free West". This is an absolute disgrace. The best we can do, in my view, is to tell more truth with more people (and not be divided and pit against each other).</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a few years back my own research led me to the conclusion that we can all live in peace and harmony, that most misery is not natural but that it is engineered. Again, General Smedley Butler's "War is a Racket" shows this for the topic of (engineered) wars. There is a reason we were never taught about this at school. We can do so much better than collectively manifesting misery. I'll leave it at that.</p>
