<a name="yaidom" class="anchor" href="#yaidom"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Yaidom: yet another Scala XML query API</h3>

<p>Yaidom is a uniform XML query API, written in Scala. Equally important, yaidom provides several specific-purpose DOM-like tree implementations adhering to this XML query API. What's more, other implementations can easily be added.</p>

<p>Yaidom initially stood for yet another (Scala) immutable DOM-like API. Over time, the yaidom XML query API grew more important than any single DOM-like tree implementation, whether immutable or mutable. Currently, the name yaidom reflects the ease with which new DOM-like tree implementations can be added, while having them conform to the yaidom query API.</p>

<p>Yaidom is described in a series of articles. The first one describes <a href="yaidom-queries.html" target="_blank">basic querying in yaidom</a>. The second one treats <a href="yaidom-and-namespaces.html" target="_blank">yaidom and namespaces</a>. Another article explains yaidom using <a href="xml-processing-with-scala-and-yaidom.html" target="_blank">XBRL examples</a>.</p>

<a name="important-stuff" class="anchor" href="#important-stuff"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Important stuff</h3>

<p>As much as I like programming, there are far more important things than software development topics that need to be discussed in these crazy times. I am referring to topics that strongly affect the world that we leave for our children and grandchildren, but that do not get the attention that they deserve.</p>

<p>I am a strong believer in free speech (especially for those who are courageous enough to challenge the "mainstream narrative"), and I am convinced that we need to defend it, especially now, given the brutal attacks against free speech by the power structure (Google and Facebook closing accounts of independent thinkers is just one example). I deeply respect people who (non-violently) fight for truth and (real) justice. By real justice I mean justice for all, not the fake divide-and-conquer George Soros type of "justice" for anyone's specific "victim group".</p>

<p>One article that describes very well the current state of affairs is <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/06/01/the-deep-state-institutions-that-control-america-they-dont-care-who-you-vote-for/" target="_blank">The deep state institutions that control America don't care who you vote for</a>.
It is a small article, but still drives many points home. For example, if governments are rather low in the pyramid of power, below corporations and big banks, then voting is pointless. (But then voting with your wallet isn't!) Voting is just theatre, designed to distract us, and to give us the illusion of freedom of choice.
The late George Carlin was clear about whether we have any freedom of choice: "You don't. You have owners. They own you." Of course, ultimately, we do have freedom of choice, but only if we choose to be free.</p>

<p>The article also makes clear that several former US presidents have (at some point) warned the population about a huge conspiracy, a vast and secret network that is accountable to no one. To this "elite", we are basically useless eaters (just consider some of Henry Kissinger's quotes). If even US presidents mention this conspiracy, then the term "conspiracy theorist" becomes meaningless. "Conspiracy realist" would be more appropriate, and the opposite could then be called "coincidence theorist".</p>

<p>Such conspiracies require a sophisticated propaganda apparatus. Our "media" in the West fits the bill perfectly. See for example <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/11/02/50-facts-the-world-needs-to-know-about-mainstream-medias-relationship-with-the-us-government/" target="_blank">50 facts the world needs to know about mainstream media's relationship with the US government</a>.</p>

<p>Isn't it quite telling that former CIA director William Casey <a href="https://www.quora.com/Did-CIA-Director-William-Casey-really-say-Well-know-our-disinformation-program-is-complete-when-everything-the-American-public-believes-is-false/answer/Barbara-Honegger" target="_blank">said</a> the following: "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false"? Even if he had not said this, this quote sums up quite nicely the attitude of the Western propaganda apparatus.</p>

<p>You don't hear our "media" talk about the following: <a href="http://theantimedia.org/united-states-bombing-america/" target="_blank">If America wasn't America, the US would be bombing it</a>. Or this: <a href="http://johnpilger.com/videos/stealing-a-nation" target="_blank">Stealing a Nation</a> (the natives of the Chagos Islands could tell us a few things about our so-called "Western values"). Or this: <a href="https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2018/02/17/why-are-we-in-afghanistan/" target="_blank">Why are we in Afghanistan?</a>. Or this: <a href="https://worldmercuryproject.org/news/vaccine-program-betrayal-public-trust-institutional-corruption-part-6-7/" target="_blank">The Vaccine Program: Betrayal of Public Trust and Institutional Corruption (part 6 of 7)</a>. Or about the connections between these and countless other stories.

<p>Given that there is indeed a huge conspiracy, and that We The People are considered their enemy (that from their perspective needs to be controlled and "trimmed" to "manageable numbers"), it should come as no surprise that this power structure uses all kinds of covert weapons against us. One of the most extreme ones is <em>geo-engineering</em>. A very informative site exposing these programs is <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/" target="_blank">www.geoengineeringwatch.org</a>. It is full of documents and other material exposing climate engineering. We need to wake up about the existence of these programs, and we need to wake up fast, if not for ourselves, then at least for our children and grandchildren. So I want to urge anyone reading this (and new to this): have the courage to educate yourself about <em>climate engineering</em>, and to spread the word!</p>

<a name="censorship" class="anchor" href="#censorship"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Censorship</h3>

<p>Did I mention before that I don't quite appreciate it when freedom of speech is attacked? But that is quite clearly what the power structure is doing, for example through "social media" and Soros-sponsored "anti-fascist" fascist groups. They must be quite scared, seeing that more and more people awaken and see through the lies and deception, about every major subject that you can think of.</p>

<p>So the power structure is in a hurry to silence any critical voices. They will fail, I expect, but they do try very hard to keep controlling us, in every way possible. They try so hard that their lies become more obvious by the day. Google and Facebook clearly expose themselves as instruments of the power structure, by closing accounts of critical thinkers. Telling the truth has now become a "thought crime", or "hate speech", as far as the controllers are concerned.</p>

<p>And again, criminal programs like <em>climate engineering</em> are still going on, possibly even more so than before.</p>

<p>Early in March, 2018, it was David Icke's turn <a href="https://www.davidicke.com/video/461998/extraordinary-story-david-icke-met-anti-terrorism-officer-council-anti-extremist-co-ordinator-leicester-police-station-absolutely-must-watch" target="_blank">to meet "anti-terrorist officials"</a>. David is well-known for his non-orthodox views. He has been ridiculed for decades for his views. But the power structure is no longer laughing. David is a courageous and highly intelligent man, and he connects lots of dots not even seen by most, let alone connected. His message is one of empowerment, unity and love, and certainly not one of fear, hate and/or racism. His attackers lack the courage to debate him. This world desparately needs more people like David Icke. Whether you agree with David or not, if free speech means anything to us, we must support him (and other independent thinkers).</p>

<a name="Russophobia" class="anchor" href="#russophobia"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Russophobia</h3>

<p>As someone living in the West, I am deeply ashamed of my so-called leaders and so-called media.</p>

<p>It is April 2018 as I write this, and the Skripal poisoning and alleged chemical attacks in Syria are the latest attempts to further discredit and provoke Russian president Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. No need for proof, of course. Anti-Russia and anti-Assad hysteria is all we need, helped by a spineless "media".</p>

<p>I have never been to Syria, but the lies told by our so-called governments have become so transparent that it is clear that anything they say about the Syrian war has been made up. The same holds for anything they say about the Skripals. A little bit of logical thinking is enough to see through the lies. Just ask the obvious questions, and much of the truth reveals itself.</p>

<p>First of all, why would Russian president Putin order the attack on father and daughter Skripal, if they are no threat to Russia? Why would he do so only a few days before the Russian election? Why would this attack be performed in such a convoluted (and therefore risky) way ? Why didn't president Putin succeed in having them killed, if that was the idea? Why are we not allowed to ask these very obvious questions? Put differently, why is there suddenly a hysterical climate in which asking these and other legitimate questions is seen as "treason"? Why has the character assassination of president Putin been going on for several years now, in every way possible, using increasingly ridiculous lies? Could it be that just the ability to say no to the self-proclaimed uni-power is enough to be on the "regime change" list? I know, it is boring to ask questions that have already been asked (and answered) many times before (just not by the MSM), but our Western propaganda machine is (or was) so powerful that we all have an obligation to oppose their (pathetic and dangerous) lies and demand the truth.</p>

<p>Similarly, asking the most obvious of questions is all it takes to see through the lies about president Assad killing his own people through chemical warfare. If he was quilty of such a crime, he would have been the dumbest president in world history. Let's leave it at that.</p>

<p>Asking the right questions is also helpful in seeing through the lies of Theresa May, and of anyone agreeing with her on her so-called humanitarian (bombing) mission in Syria following the 2 (staged) events mentioned above. Why is she far less concerned with war-torn Yemen, where "ally" Saudi-Arabia commits horrendous war crimes, with full support from the UK and US? You also did not hear her complain about the half a million dead Iraqi children, due to brutal sanctions by the West. Or about the successful "democratization" of Lybia. Or about the plan (leaked just after 9/11) to "regime change" 7 countries in 5 years, including Syria. Or about her husband profiting from the US/UK/France bombing campaign. But what was also really appalling during her "explanation" (in the House of Commons) for the US/UK/France bombing campaign in Syria was the apparent enthusiasm within the House to go to war with Russia.</p>

<p>There are many indications that the mid April bombing campaign in Syria was a charade, and that presidents Assad and Putin allowed the US and its vassals to bomb some abandoned buildings in Syria in order to save face (after relentless war propaganda) and thus avert a devastating nuclear conflict. In that case we all have to thank the Syrian and Russian leadership for their role in averting a catastrophe. At the same time we have to hold the Western "governments" accountable for toying with billions of human lives. This extremely reckless behaviour is nothing less than an unspeakable war crime. More and more "the West" exposes itself as an highly organized crime syndicate masquerading as governments, or, as a bright person said the other day, "running government simulation programs".</p>

<p>By the way, even if the West saved face by being allowed to bomb some abandoned buildings, they did so in a stupid way. After all, they claimed having bombed a chemical weapons production facility. But, wait a minute, is that not waging chemical warfare? Of course there was no chemical weapons production facility in the first place. The transparent lies of the West show us how desperate they are to start a (real military) war with Russia as soon as possible. See also <a href="http://www.theblogmire.com/did-you-really-drop-bombs-on-a-chemical-weapons-facility-mrs-may/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>

<p>There's already quite a lot that is known about the probable truth, and at the rate at which the Western lies about Syria and the Skripals are currently being unmasked, it is likely that soon much more truth will reveal itself. One interesting article in this regard is <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/04/22/syrian-doctor-in-douma-has-some-serious-doubts-over-the-chemical-gas-attack/" target="_blank">Syrian doctor in Douma has some serious doubts over the chemical gas attack</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and right on topic, the attacks against the people in the West (and not only there) in the form of <em>climate engineering</em> still goes on. Indeed, we are run by psychopaths, as David Icke has been making clear for decades.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rate at which we collectively rise in consciousness is such that each next false flag attack exposes the dark powers-that-were more and more. I am confident that the time is right for fundamental positive changes in our world.</p>

<a name="Geoengineering" class="anchor" href="#geoengineering"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Geoengineering</h3>

<p>It is of course hard to wake up to the fact that geoengineering programs are and have long been a reality. It may shatter ones belief systems. Still, that is no reason for pretending it is not happening. After all, we have a responsibility to our children and grandchildren, and to the greater good.</p>
<p>Dane Wigington, who exposes these programs at <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org" target="_blank">geoengineeringwatch.org</a>, has now a FAQ in the form of some small yet excellent videos, explaining geoengineering to people who are starting to wake up to this stark reality.</p>
<p>This material can be found at <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/geoengineering-answers-to-the-most-commonly-asked-questions/" target="_blank">GeoEngineering FAQ</a>. The videos are very accessible. I think Dane is absolutely right in that we must have the courage to face this issue, and these videos may be a good first step.</p>
<p>Once aware of these programs, we cannot keep silent. I think the following quote from Martin Luther King Jr. (used by Dane) is very suitable: <q><em>There comes a time when silence is betrayal</em></q>.</p>

<a name="War on Humanity" class="anchor" href="#war-on-humanity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>War on Humanity</h3>

<p>Through the education system and the media we have all been made to believe that war, poverty and disease are inevitable facts of life. In the West we may believe that war and poverty happen "elsewhere", but this does not change the commonly held belief that all this misery is somehow inevitable, that it is "just the way it is".</p>
<p>What if that is not the case? What if almost all misery in the world has been engineered, but that this has been hidden from us? Increasingly many people think this is indeed the case, and not without reason. Hard as it may be to accept this, I would agree with them. Below I want to make the case that the natural order is (or at least should be) <em>peace, prosperity and excellent health</em>, and that the current quite different state of affairs is the result of a massive deception. Maybe the biggest deception is the belief that we (common people) have no power. (I have to thank many courageous influential people for helping me realize the deception, including David Icke, who goes much deeper into the rabbit hole than I do here.)</p>
<p>And remember this: if someone is called a "conspiracy theorist" (a term introduced by the CIA after the murder of JFK, to discredit truth seekers), he or she is in good company. Many former US presidents and other powerful people have warned us of just that: huge conspiracies of people wielding more power than they did.</p>
<p>In order to see through the BS, let's first come up with a few questions and terms that may help in finding (much of) the truth about most of the important topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cui bono? In other words, who benefits? (Note that truth is often multi-layered, and that different groups at different levels may all profit, but in different ways.)</li>
<li>Could it be true that all misery is (at some level) a business model? (Follow the money.)</li>
<li>Problem-reaction-solution (PRS, a term introduced by David Icke).</li>
<li>The totalitarian tiptoe (also from David Icke).</li>
<li>Whom are you not allowed to criticize? That may well be where the real power is (Voltaire).</li>
<li>Who is silenced, and (how and) why?</li>
<li>Are there any verifiable facts that are hidden from us by the mainstream media? In other words, let's not be mindless consumers of the mainstream propaganda outlets, but let's actively search for truthful reporting.</li>
<li>Are there any obvious inconsistencies in an official story? In other words, let's use some logical thinking.</li>
<li>Are there just too many coincidences in one or more official stories? In other words, let's use some common sense.</li>
<li>How are we being manipulated by word games and the "dumbing down" of language?</li>
<li>How are we being divided, and, if applicable, who controls both sides of the fence (divide-and-conquer)?</li>
<li>To what extent do we recognize our own hypocracy, and to what extent does it keep us from seeing clearly?</li>
<li>Using your conscience, is "it" right? For example, killing innocent children (for example in Yemen and Iraq) can never ever be right.</li>
<li>What admissions have been made by people in the know (especially if those admissions have been hidden from the general public)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's explain PRS (problem-reaction-solution) by an example. Suppose, as a "government" (bought and paid for by a hidden criminal Cabal), you want to move society towards fascism, where there is obviously no place for any dissent. In order to achieve this, it is essential that the population is unarmed, so any dissenters can easily be rounded up. Yet how do you disarm the citizens (assuming gun ownership is allowed)? That would require some major deception, making citizens believe that it is in their interest to do so. Enter PRS. You (the "government") create a problem, namely the next false flag school shooting (blamed on some poor patsy). The citizens are horrified by the (real or perceived) loss of young lives, and react by demanding more protection from the state (the actual perpetrators). The state provides the "solution", in the form of more surveillance, more police state and more gun control (fewer arms for the citizens, more arms for "law enforcement"). Note that in order for PRS to work, a gullible easily controllable citizenry is needed. If the citizens see through the deception and do not react in "fear mode", PRS does not work. (Fortunately many US citizens are now aware of these and other false flag attacks.)</p>
<p>Let's now give an example of the totalitarian tiptoe. This is a quote from Jean-Claude Juncker (on the introduction of the Euro): "We decide on something, leave it lying around, and wait and see what happens. If no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don't understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back.". In other words, if their agenda is malevolent (for which enough supporting evidence can be found; see for example <a href="https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2018/09/17/is-hungary-the-last-remaining-european-country/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/22793-refugee-crisis-using-chaos-to-build-power" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/8872-eu-creates-dictatorship-under-guise-of-financial-stability" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://planetfreewill.com/catastrophic-eu-passes-copyright-directive-including-internet-link-tax-and-upload-filter/" target="_blank">here</a>), then to Jean-Claude Juncker we are frogs in water that he and his ilk are slowly boiling, while we frogs don't see our demise coming. Note that the totalitarian tiptoe and PRS often go hand in hand, in order to serve ambitious malevolent agendas.</p>
<p>Word games and the disappearance of words are another way of controlling us. Let's face it: language is important in shaping our thoughts. Let's take the word <em>slavery</em>. If that word disappears from our language, we can no longer successfully express that we are slaves to a system, for example, or that modern day slavery is rampant (and not only a thing of the past). The next generation would not even know the word slavery, so may be unable to even grasp the notion of being a slave. Word games (like the hijacking of words and phrases) are dangerous to our consciousness as well. Take the notion of "national security". To a nation that wants to mind its own business it is just that: national security. To an empire it is a notion with a covert meaning: unchallenged supremacy, and the excuse to do everything it takes to achieve that, no matter the consequences. In our Orwellian society, word games are everywhere, and it is very easy to fall prey to them.</p>
<p>Using the "tools" mentioned above, and many links to (mostly non-MSM) articles, let's shed some light on "the grand deception" (well, actually, the deception that can be found more or less at the surface, without going very deep). Let's do so (briefly) for different but still related topics, such as war, media, banking, medicine, weather, nutrition etc. Let's start with the topic of war:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are there so many wars all the time? For one, war is very profitable to the "elite", who own the big banks and big corporations. This has been explained by highly decorated general Smedley Butler in his book <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket" target="_blank">War is a Racket</a>.</li>
<li>Ask yourself: why haven't we heard about this book at school, in history class? Could it be that we are supposed to support illegal wars of aggression (masquerading as noble humanitarian missions), and therefore to be kept in the dark about the real reasons of war? Note that as long as we regard the waging of war "human nature", and therefore inevitable, we cannot see that war is a (covertly created) false paradigm we have been programmed to accept as being natural, horrible as it may be. This powerful but small and very affordable book is the perfect antidote to that false perception.</li>
<li>Isn't it also telling that the mainstream media do not tell us that Washington is an empire guided by the <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/wolfowitz-doctrine-us-plan-global-supremacy/" target="_blank">Wolfowitz doctrine</a> and the paper <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3249.htm" target="_blank">Rebuilding America's Defenses</a>, in other words, the ideology of establishing a dystopian unipolar world?</li>
<li>Note that the Wolfowitz Doctrine dictates that a sovereign Russia cannot be tolerated. Hence the relentless demonization of Russia and its leadership (for lack of the possibility to bomb this powerful country into the stone age).</li>
<li>For that, the mainstream media in the West act as a propaganda machine, spitting out lies about Russia 24/7, repeating the same lies over and over (following a successful strategy used by Joseph Goebbels a few decades earlier). More about the controlled MSM later.</li>
<li>I said this is all lies, because all this Russia bashing has been debunked. "Russian aggression" in the Ukraine was in reality a US "regime change" operation, destabilizing (and looting) the region. The "annexation of Crimea" was a peaceful reunification (that could not be postponed given the circumstances), while making sure that the Sevastopol military base would not become a US base (and therefore a huge threat to Russia). MH17 was immediately exploited by the late John McCain (a notorious warmonger), who (again) tried to start another world war by baselessly blaiming Russia (ask yourself, who benefits?). Russiagate was debunked by the courageous whistleblower William Binney. The Skripal case against Russia was too transparent a lie to be taken seriously. And so on, and so on. Do not believe me, but please research for yourself. Do not expect any valid answers from the controlled MSM, however.</li>
<li>At the same time, violating an old agreement with Gorbachev, NATO keeps expanding eastwards, and regularly plays war games very close to the Russian border, thus putting us all in danger. How convenient that the MSM is silent about that. Then, if Russia responds in any way to the provocations, the MSM cries wolf. This is how despicable our MSM has become.</li>
<li>How convenient that the MSM is silent about Putins greatest speeches (for example in Munich in 2007). Hearing (or reading the transcripts of) these speeches paints a far more balanced picture of modern Russia and its leadership, but that is obviously not what Washington wants, given its ideology of unchallenged supremacy.</li>
<li>Again, realize that demonization of Russia is official policy in the West, dictated by the Wolfowitz doctrine, so any lie will do. Given Russia's non-aggressive behaviour in spite of all provocations, and given that present day Russia is in many ways in a far better shape than it was in the darker days some decades ago, there can be no Russia bashing without constantly telling lies. (How convenient then to "forget" that Russia has evolved a lot in the last few decades, and to downplay and quickly forget the wildly successful 2018 World Cup.)</li>
<li>War with Russia is unthinkable in terms of its consequences. This makes all those who push for it war criminals of the worst kind. This includes many heads of government, which makes clear that these so-called governments have become nothing but (divisions of) crime syndicates masquerading as governments. Also mind that these criminals are not the ones doing the fighting. They are the cowards hiding in underground bases while we all would suffer the consequences.</li>
<li>To put the "Russian aggression" in perspective, who drops 12 bombs per hour, while officially not being at war with any country, who has military bases all over the world, who is waging war or playing war games at whose borders, who is toppling governments all over the world and has done so for ages? Should such an empire not stop pretending to be the moral leader of the world?</li>
<li>Remember what general Wesley Clark said about destroying 7 countries in 5 years, including Lybia, Syria, Sudan, Iraq and Iran. It's not like he was telling BS, right? How strange then that Iran is currently one of the biggest "national security" threats to the US.</li>
<li>The "script" for "regime change" operations (by the empire) looks a lot like described <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/437118-nicaragua-venezuela-us-coup/" target="_blank">here</a>. That's good to remember next time when the Washington empire "stands by the people of country X" or says that "the people of country X deserve a far better leader" (one who allows the empire to loot the country, that is). Strangling a country economically is business as usual in this "regime change" script. Remember the half a million dead Iraqi children (due to brutal sanctions) who were worth it, according to war criminal Madeleine Albright? Note the PRS (problem-reaction-solution) pattern again (in the economic warfare followed by regime change). It takes a very strong, informed and courageous population to refrain from reacting according to the "script".</li>
<li>Currently unspeakable war crimes are committed by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, but hey, they are our allies, and we (in the West, led by the US and UK) happily provide them with weapons.</li>
<li>Then why don't we citizens stop all those wars, by ceasing to cooperate? For one, Nazi Hermann Goering explained well (during the Nuernberg tribunals) how the leaders get the populace to support wars, although the citizens have nothing to gain from that. If we want to prove Goering wrong this time, we have to be a lot more street-wise about how we are being played by the power structure.</li>
<li>A commonly used "elite" tool for pushing us towards war is PRS. A false flag attack is often the perfect (artificially created) problem, creating the fear that makes the citizens easily controllable, and causing the desired reaction.</li>
<li>History has indeed its share of false flag attacks, as described <a href="https://washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/41-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Talking about false flag attacks, operation Gladio and operation Northwoods have been declassified. The mother of all false flags is likely to be 9/11. The official story about 9/11 is too ridiculous to be taken seriously, and has been debunked by thousands of credible experts. Let's also not forget tower 7, which collapsed in free fall, despite not being hit by anything.</li>
<li>Let's not believe that "the EU or NATO kept us out of war" (especially the last few decades). This is a transparent lie, given all that has been mentioned above. The Christmas Truce in WW1 shows the "cannon fodder" did not want war, but they were forced by the higher-ups to fight ordinary folks just like them. Not wanting war is the natural state of affairs (for the 99%). It was the case then, as it is now. Only by deceitful manipulation are we made to accept war.</li>
<li>Again, if we are not in fear, and if we see through these agendas, we cannot be controlled like we used to be.</li>
<li>Ultimately, war is a false paradigm that is still kept alive by all of us. It is a false paradigm because it goes against "natural justice" and the golden rule. We have the power to take the profit out of war, if we really want to, thus ending war once and for all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's now go one level deeper and turn our attention to central banking, and its relationship to wars:</p>
<ul>
<li>It could be said that <a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/11/20/all-wars-are-bankers-wars/" target="_blank">all wars are bankers' wars</a>, including the world wars.</li>
<li>Again, ask yourself why we haven't learned at school about the connection between central banking and wars.</li>
<li>In the documentary found in the link above, Michael Rivero makes the case that the purpose of war is to force central banks on countries that try to issue their own money.</li>
<li>Why would the bankers want to have central banks in all countries? That's because those central banks are extremely profitable to them and their friends in big business, at the expense of everyone else.</li>
<li>How come? Central banking is a racket masquerading as a sound functioning monetary system. Their scam is the creation of "money" out of thin air, as an interest-bearing debt. This makes all of us debt slaves, while the central bankers keep getting richer without providing anything of value themselves. After all, they can print "money" out of thin air (or even just "create money" as mere numbers in a computer), without it being backed by anything (other than a powerful military that can force others to accept this "money" as payments). See for example <a href="https://educate-yourself.org/cn/centralbankscam22feb15.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2017/09/the-rothschilds-central-banking-system-of-interest-slavery-explained/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Take the Federal Reserve, created in 1913 by the treasonous Federal Reserve Act. Although its name suggests otherwise, it is neither federal nor has anything (worth mentioning) in reserve. In other words, the US has delegated its monetary policy to a private corporation, motivated by extreme greed. Now maybe "the US" itself is a private corporation instead of a republic, as can be found <a href="http://annavonreitz.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Very high in the pyramid of power, way above governments, sits the Bank for International Settlements, which is "the central bank of central banks". It is the BIS where the so-called opposing parties were discussing who would contribute what for the WW2 "play", while not far away from the BIS in Basel (across the border) the war was raging. By the way, Ford corporation secretly contributed military vehicles to Germany, and the Bush dynasty helped finance Nazi Germany. No wonder the Bush family later on provided 2 US presidents. To these people, wars are just a very profitable play that furthers their agenda (of centralized control by the banking cartel).</li>
<li>In his documentary, Rivero makes the compelling case that WW1 was a bankers' war in which Germany was punished for the limitations it imposed on its central bank. Indeed, Germany was severely punished financially for a war it had not even started.</li>
<li>It is interesting to regard the hidden history of the US, and the role of central banking. For example, the attempted military coup against Roosevelt, in order to install a corporate fascist state. It was none other than general Smedley Butler who exposed the plot. I guess someone forgot to tell us about this conspirary in history class.</li>
<li>Obviously, the suspension of the gold standard by US president Nixon made the dollar a "fiat" currency not backed by anything of value. Well, it was from that point on backed by somebody else's oil, in a protection racket where other countries were forced to trade oil in dollars, in exchange for not being invaded. Did I just describe the mafia (only worse)?</li>
<li>Remember the 7 countries mentioned by Wesley Clark? What a coincidence that these countries had no central banks before the invasion. What a coincidence that the leaders of several of these countries had funny ideas about trading oil in other currencies than the dollar. Somehow the "war on terror", Iraq's WMDs, Assad "killing his own people" (yet still being re-elected) sound like cheap but criminal lies. Of course we all know that the WMD story was a lie, but let's please be vigilant when the next illegal war of aggression is sold to us.</li>
<li>All in all, there is much to be said for the thesis that all wars are bankers' wars. It's also about resources (e.g. oil) and mega-profits for banks and their friends in Wall Street, but these goals are in no way contradictory.</li>
<li>So here we are. We denounce slavery (therefore modern slavery has to be hidden from us) and the divine right to rule (therefore the power of monarchs has to be hidden), but we have now become debt slaves, covertly ruled by central banks. (Just ask the people in Greece, for example.)</li>
<li>What can we do? At the very least, understand the massive deception, inform each other, support each other, stay away from orchestrated drama, and cease to cooperate with the system where possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so we have illegal wars of aggression engineered by a criminal cabal. But what if we were not controlled by an international crime syndicate, there was no empire, but we still had to contend for finite resources? Would we still not fight many wars over those resources?</p>
<ul>
<li>After all, fossil fuels are finite resources, right? But what if we do not even need them, and there exists a highly advanced but hidden body of scientific knowledge that is far beyond what is known in the public domain? For example, <a href="https://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/01/02/nikola-teslas-5-lost-inventions-that-threatened-the-global-elite/" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla</a> became a threat to the "elite" with some of his inventions, so these inventions had to be kept secret from us. Well, that is <a href="www.collective-evolution.com/2018/03/11/if-you-think-invention-secrecy-is-a-conspiracy-theory-youve-just-been-proven-wrong/" target="_blank">business as usual</a> for the "elite", don't you think?</li>
<li>If indeed these current secrets become common knowledge, and there is indeed more than enough of everything we need for everyone on this planet, now and in the future, there is absolutely no reason for common people to wage war over resources.</li>
<li>So, if we no longer cooperate with our current controllers when they want war, and we have no reason to wage war ourselves if those controllers are no longer in power, there clearly is no reason to wage war at all. War and poverty are artificial creations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's now consider the "media", without which all the illegal wars of aggression could never have taken place:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deceptions to trick us into accepting wars of aggression, as well as other deceptions not yet mentioned, could never have been possible without controlled media, obedient to the power structure. (It could also not have been possible if we were much harder to manipulate, in which case there would be no reason for dishonest controlled media outlets to exist in the first place.)</li>
<li>Take 9/11. There are huge holes in the official account, but where are the real journalists in the MSM actually investigating 9/11? It does not matter if the media outlets are left-wing or right-wing (another false paradigm to keep us divided), questioning the official 9/11 lie is the worst possible career move for a "journalist" (ok, honest reporting about Russia is possibly even worse).</li>
<li>Take the late Udo Ulfkotte, who wrote the book <em>Gekaufte Journalisten</em>, exposing all MSM outlets in the West as an extension of the CIA. Any MSM journalist mentioning his name is immediately fired. The "book burners" have made sure that the English translation of this book cannot be bought. Does the power structure have anything to hide?</li>
<li>Udo Ulfkotte indeed exposed the MSM for what they are. See also <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/11/02/50-facts-the-world-needs-to-know-about-mainstream-medias-relationship-with-the-us-government/" target="_blank">50 facts the world needs to know about mainstream media's relationship with the US government</a>.</li>
<li>It is not just that the MSM fails to do its job, it is also complicit in many crimes committed by the power structure. For example, honest media outlets would engage in real journalism, and show us our complicity in the war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, largely against innocent women and children. Honest media would refrain from war mongering, instead of being strongly tied to shady (power structure) organizations like the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, etc., acting as their ministry of propaganda, and selling their wars of aggression.</li>
<li>What's more, the MSM also plays a large part in the censorship that is taking hold in the West (and not only there). They basically try to make us accept war with Russia, and violently attack any "dissenters". They also for the most part try to silence any alternative voices, denouncing their message as "fake news", as if they are the arbiter of truth. The MSM has now really become a sorry bunch, quickly losing influence, after spreading lies that are simply way too transparent. The Skripal poisoning blamed on Russia, just days before the re-election of president Putin, is a clear example. Udo Ulfkotte was certainly right that the MSM "journalists" have been bought and paid for.</li>
<li>Mr. Ulfkotte has also exposed us for what we have become ourselves to a large extent. After all, the corruptability, self-deception and cowardice that he describes so well in his book is something that we all have to face within ourselves as well. In that regard his book is very confronting, acting as a mirror.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is obvious that we are ruled by a criminal international banking cartel, who in close cooperation with the large corporations and most governments covertly hold us hostage. Whenever wars advance their hidden agenda (as well as their bottom line), they deceive us into accepting those wars. They obviously could not care less about the costs in loss of lives, being the psychopaths they are. Still, we haven't scratched the surface of what the power structure does to the general population. They wage many covert wars against us that we may not even be aware of. Let's now turn our attention to some of the many types of covert warfare waged against us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take geo-engineering and weather warfare. For all who have the courage to look at the evidence, it can be found at <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/" target="_blank">geoengineeringwatch.org</a>. A solid introduction can be found at <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/geoengineering-answers-to-the-most-commonly-asked-questions/" target="_blank">GeoEngineering FAQ</a>.</li>
<li>Again, it is the central bankers who are deeply involved in these programs. See for example <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/?s=bankers" target="_blank">interview with Kevin Shipp</a> to get a feel for how the CIA helps enforce the agenda of the central bankers, instead of protecting the US constitution.</li>
<li>Just imagine how powerful geo-engineering is as a covert weapon against (potentially unsuspecting) countries. Weather warfare can easily destroy crops, and make people rebel against their leaders, thus leading to "regime change" (unless the citizens are well-informed as well as very courageous and supportive of their government).</li>
<li>What a coincidence then that all 7 countries on the regime change list mentioned by general Wesley Clark suffered from record droughts.</li>
<li>Also in our "democracies" we suffer from these programs. After all, how can spraying millions of tons of aluminium and other nano-particles (worldwide), much of which in NATO countries, be anything but detrimental to our health? Let that sink in for a moment: the power structure (that owns our "governments") at the very least does not care if they slowly kill us.</li>
<li>We are also woefully uninformed about <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/war/haarp_weather_modification_electromagnetic_warfare_weapons" target="_blank">HAARP</a>.</li>
<li>For the sake of our children, grandchildren and our planet, we must all have the courage to face this dark reality of geo-engineering and weather warfare, and to spread the word (sharing credible data, as Dane Wigington stresses).</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly the power structure cares a lot about our well-being. Not only the air we breath is weaponized:</p>
<ul>
<li>So is the food we eat. See for example <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/026907_food_vaccination_health.html" target="_blank">weaponized food and medicine</a>.</li>
<li>And so is the water we drink, which in many regions is purposefully contaminated with fluoride, which is toxic waste. See for example <a href="http://www.stopthecrime.net/smartmeters/toxicdrinkingwater/How%20did%20the%20Flouride%20Scam%20Begin_.pdf" target="_blank">the fluoride scam</a>. In case you think they could not possibly dupe us all, and that we would know, read this PDF about the fluoride scam. In all honesty, we have been played like small children by the power structure, who made us all believe that fluoride was good for our teeth.</li>
<li>So are vaccines. See for example <a href="https://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/06/12/the-ongoing-thimerosal-mercury-travesty-needs-to-end/" target="_blank">the Thimerosal travesty</a>.</li>
<li>So is 5G. See for example <a href="http://stopthecrime.net/wp/category/5g-info/" target="_blank">stop the 5G crime</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not very surprisingly (at this point), it does not stop there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given all these crimes against humanity, should it surprise us that disease is also weaponized, and that Big Medicine suppresses the cures? After all, it is far better for their bottom line to have chronically ill customers than a healthy population. It is just another example of PRS, requiring a population that is unknowingly taken hostage by Big Pharma. See for example <a href="http://www.truthwiki.org/american-medical-association-ama/" target="_blank">AMA</a>.</li>
<li>How strange that we never learned about Morris Fishbein at school, and what he meant for (the destruction of) the medical profession. In spite of there being very many well-intentioned professionals in the medical field, in essence Big Medicine is a huge business scam. Combined with the weaponization of food, water and air, it becomes clear that we could and should all be healthy, but that does not fit the agenda.</li>
<li>There is a huge worldwide human trafficking operation that we are far too silent about. See <a href="https://prepareforchange.net/2018/09/03/witness-statement-by-satanic-ritual-abuse-survivor-fiona-barnett-calling-out-her-pedophile-abusers/" target="_blank">witness statement by satanic ritual abuse survivor, Fiona Barnett</a>. Although this is almost unbelievable, it is still reality. How can we possibly let this go on? Also read her conclusion about the huge implications of this worldwide operation, and therefore the implications of ending it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said before, I am only scratching the surface here. To get a much deeper insight into how we are being deceived and controlled, and how to free ourselves, I happily refer to the books of David Icke. Many others also show the way out of the matrix (some of the links above refer to sites that have a very empowering message).</p>
<p>In summary, I think that the case has been made that war, poverty and disease are the results of the power structure controlling us. The natural state of affairs is <em>peace, abundance and excellent health</em>.</p>
<p>It is quite understandable to be pissed off with the ruling elite. Still, the worst thing we can do is to use that anger in a destructive way. It would not bring us further as a collective that gets ready to embrace a new paradigm, a new world that works for all of us, including our planet itself. Moreover, it would not work in the sense that the elite knows perfectly well how to channel negative energy and use it to divide us further. Also note that the elite themselves are mind control victims (if you do your research about this, it turns out that trauma-based mind control is the norm within elite circles, and that it is only logical that this is the case). Just suppose we would have undergone the same amount of mind control. Would we have been any better "rulers"?</p>
<p>Let me end by saying that we must spread truths, for example about geo-engineering and human trafficking, in order to reach a critical mass of awareness. Moreover, I sincerely hope that we see through the massive deception, and that we will collectively create the new paradigm of peace, abundance and excellent health.</p>
