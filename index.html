<p>Yaidom is a uniform XML query API, written in Scala. Equally important, yaidom provides several specific-purpose DOM-like tree implementations adhering to this XML query API. What's more, other implementations can easily be added.</p>

<p>Yaidom initially stood for yet another (Scala) immutable DOM-like API. Over time, the yaidom XML query API grew more important than any single DOM-like tree implementation, whether immutable or mutable. Currently, the name yaidom reflects the ease with which new DOM-like tree implementations can be added, while having them conform to the yaidom query API.</p>

<p>Yaidom is described in a series of articles. The first one describes <a href="yaidom-queries.html" target="_blank">basic querying in yaidom</a>. The second one treats <a href="yaidom-and-namespaces.html" target="_blank">yaidom and namespaces</a>. Another article explains yaidom using <a href="xml-processing-with-scala-and-yaidom.html" target="_blank">XBRL examples</a>.</p>

<p>My yaidom presentation at XML London 2015 is <a href="xml-london-2015" target="_blank">XML processing with Scala and yaidom</a>.</p>

<a name="important-stuff" class="anchor" href="#important-stuff"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Important stuff</h3>

<p>As much as I like programming, there are far more important things than software development topics that need to be discussed in these crazy times. I am referring to topics that strongly affect the world that we leave for our children and grandchildren, but that do not get the attention that they deserve.</p>

<p>I am a strong believer in free speech (especially for those who are courageous enough to challenge the "mainstream narrative"), and I am convinced that we need to defend it, especially now, given the brutal attacks against free speech by the power structure (Google and Facebook closing accounts of independent thinkers is just one example). I deeply respect people who (non-violently) fight for truth and (real) justice. By real justice I mean justice for all, not the fake divide-and-conquer George Soros type of "justice" for anyone's specific "victim group".</p>

<p>One article that describes very well the current state of affairs is <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/06/01/the-deep-state-institutions-that-control-america-they-dont-care-who-you-vote-for/" target="_blank">The deep state institutions that control America don't care who you vote for</a>.
It is a small article, but still drives many points home. For example, if governments are rather low in the pyramid of power, below corporations and big banks, then voting is pointless. (But then voting with your wallet isn't!) Voting is just theatre, designed to distract us, and to give us the illusion of freedom of choice.
The late George Carlin was clear about whether we have any freedom of choice: "You don't. You have owners. They own you." Of course, ultimately, we do have freedom of choice, but only if we choose to be free.</p>

<p>The article also makes clear that several former US presidents have (at some point) warned the population about a huge conspiracy, a vast and secret network that is accountable to no one. To this "elite", we are basically useless eaters (just consider some of Henry Kissinger's quotes). If even US presidents mention this conspiracy, then the term "conspiracy theorist" becomes meaningless. "Conspiracy realist" would be more appropriate, and the opposite could then be called "coincidence theorist".</p>

<p>Such conspiracies require a sophisticated propaganda apparatus. Our "media" in the West fits the bill perfectly. See for example <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/11/02/50-facts-the-world-needs-to-know-about-mainstream-medias-relationship-with-the-us-government/" target="_blank">50 facts the world needs to know about mainstream media's relationship with the US government</a>.</p>

<p>Isn't it quite telling that former CIA director William Casey <a href="https://www.quora.com/Did-CIA-Director-William-Casey-really-say-Well-know-our-disinformation-program-is-complete-when-everything-the-American-public-believes-is-false/answer/Barbara-Honegger" target="_blank">said</a> the following: "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false"? Even if he had not said this, this quote sums up quite nicely the attitude of the Western propaganda apparatus.</p>

<p>You don't hear our "media" talk about the following: <a href="http://theantimedia.org/united-states-bombing-america/" target="_blank">If America wasn't America, the US would be bombing it</a>. Or this: <a href="http://johnpilger.com/videos/stealing-a-nation" target="_blank">Stealing a Nation</a> (the natives of the Chagos Islands could tell us a few things about our so-called "Western values"). Or this: <a href="https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2018/02/17/why-are-we-in-afghanistan/" target="_blank">Why are we in Afghanistan?</a>. Or this: <a href="https://worldmercuryproject.org/news/vaccine-program-betrayal-public-trust-institutional-corruption-part-6-7/" target="_blank">The Vaccine Program: Betrayal of Public Trust and Institutional Corruption (part 6 of 7)</a>. Or about the connections between these and countless other stories.

<p>Given that there is indeed a huge conspiracy, and that We The People are considered their enemy (that from their perspective needs to be controlled and "trimmed" to "manageable numbers"), it should come as no surprise that this power structure uses all kinds of covert weapons against us. One of the most extreme ones is <em>geo-engineering</em>. A very informative site exposing these programs is <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/" target="_blank">www.geoengineeringwatch.org</a>. It is full of documents and other material exposing climate engineering. We need to wake up about the existence of these programs, and we need to wake up fast, if not for ourselves, then at least for our children and grandchildren. So I want to urge anyone reading this (and new to this): have the courage to educate yourself about <em>climate engineering</em>, and to spread the word!</p>

<a name="censorship" class="anchor" href="#censorship"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Censorship</h3>

<p>Did I mention before that I don't quite appreciate it when freedom of speech is attacked? But that is quite clearly what the power structure is doing, for example through "social media" and Soros-sponsored "anti-fascist" fascist groups. They must be quite scared, seeing that more and more people awaken and see through the lies and deception, about every major subject that you can think of.</p>

<p>So the power structure is in a hurry to silence any critical voices. They will fail, I expect, but they do try very hard to keep controlling us, in every way possible. They try so hard that their lies become more obvious by the day. Google and Facebook clearly expose themselves as instruments of the power structure, by closing accounts of critical thinkers. Telling the truth has now become a "thought crime", or "hate speech", as far as the controllers are concerned.</p>

<p>And again, criminal programs like <em>climate engineering</em> are still going on, possibly even more so than before.</p>

<p>Early in March, 2018, it was David Icke's turn <a href="https://www.davidicke.com/video/461998/extraordinary-story-david-icke-met-anti-terrorism-officer-council-anti-extremist-co-ordinator-leicester-police-station-absolutely-must-watch" target="_blank">to meet "anti-terrorist officials"</a>. David is well-known for his non-orthodox views. He has been ridiculed for decades for his views. But the power structure is no longer laughing. David is a courageous and highly intelligent man, and he connects lots of dots not even seen by most, let alone connected. His message is one of empowerment, unity and love, and certainly not one of fear, hate and/or racism. His attackers lack the courage to debate him. This world desparately needs more people like David Icke. Whether you agree with David or not, if free speech means anything to us, we must support him (and other independent thinkers).</p>

<a name="Russophobia" class="anchor" href="#russophobia"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Russophobia</h3>

<p>As someone living in the West, I am deeply ashamed of my so-called leaders and so-called media.</p>

<p>It is April 2018 as I write this, and the Skripal poisoning and alleged chemical attacks in Syria are the latest attempts to further discredit and provoke Russian president Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. No need for proof, of course. Anti-Russia and anti-Assad hysteria is all we need, helped by a spineless "media".</p>

<p>I have never been to Syria, but the lies told by our so-called governments have become so transparent that it is clear that anything they say about the Syrian war has been made up. The same holds for anything they say about the Skripals. A little bit of logical thinking is enough to see through the lies. Just ask the obvious questions, and much of the truth reveals itself.</p>

<p>First of all, why would Russian president Putin order the attack on father and daughter Skripal, if they are no threat to Russia? Why would he do so only a few days before the Russian election? Why would this attack be performed in such a convoluted (and therefore risky) way ? Why didn't president Putin succeed in having them killed, if that was the idea? Why are we not allowed to ask these very obvious questions? Put differently, why is there suddenly a hysterical climate in which asking these and other legitimate questions is seen as "treason"? Why has the character assassination of president Putin been going on for several years now, in every way possible, using increasingly ridiculous lies? Could it be that just the ability to say no to the self-proclaimed uni-power is enough to be on the "regime change" list? I know, it is boring to ask questions that have already been asked (and answered) many times before (just not by the MSM), but our Western propaganda machine is (or was) so powerful that we all have an obligation to oppose their (pathetic and dangerous) lies and demand the truth.</p>

<p>Similarly, asking the most obvious of questions is all it takes to see through the lies about president Assad killing his own people through chemical warfare. If he was quilty of such a crime, he would have been the dumbest president in world history. Let's leave it at that.</p>

<p>Asking the right questions is also helpful in seeing through the lies of Theresa May, and of anyone agreeing with her on her so-called humanitarian (bombing) mission in Syria following the 2 (staged) events mentioned above. Why is she far less concerned with war-torn Yemen, where "ally" Saudi-Arabia commits horrendous war crimes, with full support from the UK and US? You also did not hear her complain about the half a million dead Iraqi children, due to brutal sanctions by the West. Or about the successful "democratization" of Lybia. Or about the plan (leaked just after 9/11) to "regime change" 7 countries in 5 years, including Syria. Or about her husband profiting from the US/UK/France bombing campaign. But what was also really appalling during her "explanation" (in the House of Commons) for the US/UK/France bombing campaign in Syria was the apparent enthusiasm within the House to go to war with Russia.</p>

<p>There are many indications that the mid April bombing campaign in Syria was a charade, and that presidents Assad and Putin allowed the US and its vassals to bomb some abandoned buildings in Syria in order to save face (after relentless war propaganda) and thus avert a devastating nuclear conflict. In that case we all have to thank the Syrian and Russian leadership for their role in averting a catastrophe. At the same time we have to hold the Western "governments" accountable for toying with billions of human lives. This extremely reckless behaviour is nothing less than an unspeakable war crime. More and more "the West" exposes itself as an highly organized crime syndicate masquerading as governments, or, as a bright person said the other day, "running government simulation programs".</p>

<p>By the way, even if the West saved face by being allowed to bomb some abandoned buildings, they did so in a stupid way. After all, they claimed having bombed a chemical weapons production facility. But, wait a minute, is that not waging chemical warfare? Of course there was no chemical weapons production facility in the first place. The transparent lies of the West show us how desperate they are to start a (real military) war with Russia as soon as possible. See also <a href="http://www.theblogmire.com/did-you-really-drop-bombs-on-a-chemical-weapons-facility-mrs-may/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>

<p>There's already quite a lot that is known about the probable truth, and at the rate at which the Western lies about Syria and the Skripals are currently being unmasked, it is likely that soon much more truth will reveal itself. One interesting article in this regard is <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/04/22/syrian-doctor-in-douma-has-some-serious-doubts-over-the-chemical-gas-attack/" target="_blank">Syrian doctor in Douma has some serious doubts over the chemical gas attack</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and right on topic, the attacks against the people in the West (and not only there) in the form of <em>climate engineering</em> still goes on. Indeed, we are run by psychopaths, as David Icke has been making clear for decades.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rate at which we collectively rise in consciousness is such that each next false flag attack exposes the dark powers-that-were more and more. I am confident that the time is right for fundamental positive changes in our world.</p>

<a name="Geoengineering" class="anchor" href="#geoengineering"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Geoengineering</h3>

<p>It is of course hard to wake up to the fact that geoengineering programs are and have long been a reality. It may shatter ones belief systems. Still, that is no reason for pretending it is not happening. After all, we have a responsibility to our children and grandchildren, and to the greater good.</p>
<p>Dane Wigington, who exposes these programs at <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org" target="_blank">geoengineeringwatch.org</a>, has now a FAQ in the form of some small yet excellent videos, explaining geoengineering to people who are starting to wake up to this stark reality.</p>
<p>This material can be found at <a href="https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/geoengineering-answers-to-the-most-commonly-asked-questions/" target="_blank">GeoEngineering FAQ</a>. The videos are very accessible. I think Dane is absolutely right in that we must have the courage to face this issue, and these videos may be a good first step.</p>
<p>Once aware of these programs, we cannot keep silent. I think the following quote from Martin Luther King Jr. (used by Dane) is very suitable: <q><em>There comes a time when silence is betrayal</em></q>.</p>
