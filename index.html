<p>Yaidom is a uniform XML query API, written in Scala. Equally important, yaidom provides several specific-purpose DOM-like tree implementations adhering to this XML query API. What's more, other implementations can easily be added.</p>

<p>Yaidom initially stood for yet another (Scala) immutable DOM-like API. Over time, the yaidom XML query API grew more important than any single DOM-like tree implementation, whether immutable or mutable. Currently, the name yaidom reflects the ease with which new DOM-like tree implementations can be added, while having them conform to the yaidom query API.</p>

<p>Yaidom is described in a series of articles. The first one describes <a href="yaidom-queries.html" target="_blank">basic querying in yaidom</a>. The second one treats <a href="yaidom-and-namespaces.html" target="_blank">yaidom and namespaces</a>. Another article explains yaidom using <a href="xml-processing-with-scala-and-yaidom.html" target="_blank">XBRL examples</a>.</p>

<p>My yaidom presentation at XML London 2015 is <a href="xml-london-2015" target="_blank">XML processing with Scala and yaidom</a>.</p>

<a name="important-stuff" class="anchor" href="#important-stuff"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Important stuff</h3>

<p>As much as I like programming, there are far more important things than development topics that need to be discussed in these crazy times. I am referring to topics that strongly affect the world that we leave for our children and grandchildren, but that do not get the attention that they deserve.</p>

<p>I am a strong believer in free speech, and I am convinced that we need to defend it, especially now, given the brutal attacks against free speech by the power structure. I deeply respect people who (non-violently) fight for truth and (real) justice. By real justice I mean justice for all, not the fake divide-and-conquer George Soros type of "justice" for anyone's specific "victim group".</p>

<p>One article that I like is <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/06/01/the-deep-state-institutions-that-control-america-they-dont-care-who-you-vote-for/" target="_blank">The deep state institutions that control America don't care who you vote for</a>.
It is a small article, but still drives many points home. For example, if governments are rather low in the pyramid of power, below corporations and big banks, then voting is pointless. It's just theatre, designed to distract us, and to give us the illusion of freedom of choice.
The late George Carlin would say about us having freedom of choice: "You don't. You have owners. They own you." Of course, ultimately, we do have freedom of choice, but only if we exercise that human right.</p>

<p>The article also makes clear that several former US presidents have (at some point) warned the population about a huge conspiracy, a vast and secret network that is accountable to no one. To them, we are basically useless eaters. If even US presidents mention this conspiracy, then the term "conspiracy theorist" becomes meaningless. "Conspiracy realist" would be more appropriate, and the opposite could then be called "coincidence theorist".</p>

<p>Given that there is indeed a huge conspiracy, and that we-the-people are considered their enemy (that from their perspective needs to be controlled and "trimmed" to "manageable numbers"), it should come as no surprise that this power structure uses all kinds of covert weapons against us. One of the most extreme ones is <em>geo-engineering</em>. A very informative site exposing these programs is <a href="http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/" target="_blank">www.geoengineeringwatch.org</a>. It is full of documents and other material exposing climate engineering. We need to wake up about the existence of these programs, and we need to wake up fast, if not for ourselves, then at least for our children and grandchildren. So I want to urge anyone reading this: have the courage to educate yourself about climate engineering, and to spread the word!</p>
