<p>This article is the first in a series of articles introducing a Scala DOM-like XML library, called <em>yaidom</em> ("yet another immutable DOM").</p>

<p>It is assumed that the reader knows the basics of XML, in particular XML namespaces. Preferably the reader knows a little bit about XML Schema as well, to make sense of the examples. Some experience with XML processing in Java (e.g. JAXP) is also helpful. Finally, the reader is expected to have some familiarity with the Scala programming language, and with the Scala Collections API in particular.</p>

<p>This article only treats basic element querying in yaidom. The remainder of this article is organized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why yet another Scala XML library?</li>
<li>Using XBRL examples. (See below.)</li>
<li>Introduction to yaidom element queries.</li>
<li>Uniform element query API.</li>
<li>Conclusion (of this first article about yaidom)</li>
</ol>

<p>Although the examples use XBRL (which stands for eXtensible Business Reporting Language), no prior XBRL knowledge is assumed on the part of the reader. With only a minimal explanation the examples are quite easy to understand.</p>

<a name="why-yet-another-scala-xml-library" class="anchor" href="#why-yet-another-scala-xml-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why yet another Scala XML library?</h3>

<p>Let's for a moment think (back) about XML manipulation in Java. XML processing in Java has never been easy. Arguably, the simplest way to manipulate XML in Java is through XML data binding solutions, such as JAXB. Such solutions try to hide the XML, making the XML look like normal Java objects. Unfortunately, in non-trivial mapping scenarios one easily ends up having to keep 2 perspectives on the same XML data in sync: the "Java object view" and the "XML view", thus creating more instead of less work.</p>

<p>Hence, O-X mapping may not be the best answer for most XML processing scenarios. On the other hand, directly manipulating XML should not have been that hard in the first place.</p>

<p>Scala could help make direct XML manipulation easy, by leveraging the Scala Collections API. The standard Scala XML API should have been the obvious choice. It predates Scala 2.8, however, and its namespace support is not as precise and clear as I would like it to be. Anti-XML aimed at being a better alternative, but that project seems abandoned. The third well-known Scala XML library is Scales XML, but this is not a DOM-like API.</p>

<p>It seems hard to find a Scala XML library having first-class namespace support, and offering precise and clear namespace handling. The best explanation of XML namespaces that I have come across is <a href="http://www.lenzconsulting.com/namespaces/">Understanding XML Namespaces</a>. It distinguishes between <em>qualified names</em> (such as my:foo) and <em>expanded names</em> (such as {http://my}foo, in James Clark notation). Many XML libraries blur this fundamental distinction. That is somewhat understandable, because expanded names do not occur syntactically in XML. Still, ignoring this distinction makes it hard to talk precisely about namespaces, thus leading to sub-par namespace support. The quest for first-class namespace support was the most important reason to come up with <em>yaidom</em>.</p>

<p>The core design principles behind yaidom are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yaidom wants to offer first class support for XML namespaces.</li>
<li>Yaidom leverages Scala and its Collections API for expressiveness, precision and clarity. No XPath-like query support is offered, even if that means a little less conciseness.</li>
<li>Yaidom leverages Java (and JAXP in particular) to deal with the gory details of XML parsing and serialization, without trying to hide JAXP behind any leaky abstraction.</li>
<li>There is no one-size-fits-all element representation, but it is still desirable to have multiple element implementation share the same yaidom element query API.</li>
</ul>

<a name="introduction-to-yaidom-element-queries" class="anchor" href="#introduction-to-yaidom-element-queries"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction to yaidom element queries</h3>

<p>Before showing some basic yaidom element queries, assume the following code to have executed:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.File
import javax.xml.parsers._
import scala.collection.immutable
import eu.cdevreeze.yaidom._

val xsNamespace = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
val xbrliNamespace = "http://www.xbrl.org/2003/instance"
val helloWorldNamespace = "http://xbrl.squarespace.com/HelloWorld"

// Using a yaidom DocumentParser that used DOM internally
val docParser = parse.DocumentParserUsingDom.newInstance

val instanceDoc: Document =
    docParser.parse(new File("/path/to/HelloWorld.xml"))
val schemaDoc: Document =
    docParser.parse(new File("/path/to/HelloWorld.xsd"))

val instanceDocElem = instanceDoc.documentElement
val schemaDocElem = schemaDoc.documentElement
</code></pre>

<p>Let's get started with some basic yaidom element queries. The HelloWorld.xml XBRL instance has some units, contexts and (top-level) facts. We can query for the units (as yaidom elements) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val unitElems =
    instanceDocElem.filterChildElems(e => e.localName == "unit")
</code></pre>

<p>In this query, we queried only for (some) <em>child elements</em> of the document element, knowing that the single unit is a child element of the document element. We also used no namespace in the query, knowing that in this case no fact has the (local) name unit, be it in another namespace.</p>

<p>Analogously, we can query for the (2) contexts (as yaidom elements) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val contextElems =
    instanceDocElem.filterChildElems(e => e.localName == "context")
</code></pre>

<p>Above, we queried for child elements with local name context. We could have queried for all <em>descendant elements</em> with local name context instead. Not surprisingly, the same elements would be returned:</p>

<pre><code>val contextElems =
    instanceDocElem.filterElems(e => e.localName == "context")
</code></pre>

<p>We could also query for all <em>descendant-or-self elements</em> with local name context. Again, the result would be the same:</p>

<pre><code>val contextElems =
    instanceDocElem.filterElemsOrSelf(e => e.localName == "context")
</code></pre>

<p>Now we know how to query for child elements, descendant elements or descendant-or-self elements, given an element predicate. Instead of writing "filterChildElems" we can write "\", and instead of writing "filterElemsOrSelf" we can write "\\", however.  This would give us:</p>

<pre><code>val contextElems = instanceDocElem \ (e => e.localName == "context")
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>val contextElems = instanceDocElem \\ (e => e.localName == "context")
</code></pre>

<p>Let's now query for the 12 top-level facts, knowing that their element names are in the namespace "http://xbrl.squarespace.com/HelloWorld":</p>

<pre><code>val factElems = instanceDocElem filterChildElems { e =>
    e.resolvedName.namespaceUriOption == Some(helloWorldNamespace)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most of yaidom's query API is easy to guess knowing the methods presented above. For example, method "findAllElems" returns all descendant elements (excluding self), and method "findAllElemsOrSelf" returns all descendant-or-self elements.</p>

<h3>
<a name="uniform-element-query-api" class="anchor" href="#uniform-element-query-api"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uniform element query API</h3>

<p>Above, we introduced basic element querying in yaidom, using the "standard" element implementation. Yaidom does not conform to the view that there is a one-size-fits-all element implementation, as we will see. Fortunately, this does not mean that there are as many yaidom element query APIs as there are element implementations. On the contrary, most element implementations mix in the ElemApi trait, which is the most important part of the query API.</p>

<p>The yaidom element query API plays very well with the Scala Collections API. Typical non-trivial queries are written as for-expressions, combining Scala collections with yaidom query API methods. In a sense, the yaidom element query API is a <em>uniform</em> element query API, and the Scala Collections API plays the role of <em>universal</em> (collection) query API.</p>

<p>Below we show yaidom as uniform query API. Again start with the same documents used above. The item declarations (which are top-level element declarations with the xbrli:item substitution group) in the schema document can be found uniformly across element implementations as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def findAllItemDeclarations[E <: ElemApi[E]](docElem: E): immutable.IndexedSeq[E] = {
    import ElemApi._
    for {
        elemDecl <- docElem \ withEName(xsNamespace, "element")
        if (elemDecl \@ EName("substitutionGroup")) == Some("xbrli:item")
    } yield elemDecl
}
</code></pre>

<p>Typical yaidom client code does not abstract over multiple element implementations, but generics are used here to show that the exact same query API works for multiple element implementations. In the function signature above, "E" is the type of the element implementation itself. We imported all members of the ElemApi companion object, to have the "withEName" element predicate builder in scope. Note that the query is not very robust, because it filters substitution groups on the qualified name, and not on the expanded name. We'll fix that later, paying the price of losing genericity.</p>

<p>Given the schema document above, we can query the item declarations as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val itemDecls =
    findAllItemDeclarations(schemaDoc.documentElement)
</code></pre>

<p>We can now check if all facts in the XBRL instance correspond to item declarations in the schema document as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val tns =
    schemaDoc.documentElement.attribute(EName("targetNamespace"))

val itemDeclsByTargetENames: Map[EName, Elem] = {
    itemDecls.map(e => (EName(tns, e.attribute(EName("name"))) -> e)).toMap
}

val factElems = instanceDoc.documentElement \ { e =>
    e.resolvedName.namespaceUriOption == Some(helloWorldNamespace)
}

require(factElems.map(e => e.resolvedName).toSet.subsetOf(
    itemDeclsByTargetENames.keySet))
</code></pre>

<p>Prefixes are insignificant in XML. Let HelloWorld2.xml be equivalent to HelloWorld.xml, except that the default namespace has been replaced by prefix "xs":<p>

<pre><code>val schemaDoc2: Document =
    docParser.parse(new File("/path/to/HelloWorld2.xsd"))
</code></pre>

<p>How can we easily assert that these documents are equivalent XML documents? To that end, yaidom offers so-called "resolved" elements, which contain only expanded (element and attribute) names, and no qualified names. Indeed:</p>

<pre><code>val rootElem = schemaDoc.documentElement
val rootElem2 = schemaDoc2.documentElement

require(resolved.Elem(rootElem).removeAllInterElementWhitespace ==
    resolved.Elem(rootElem2).removeAllInterElementWhitespace)
</code></pre>

<p>To show that the yaidom query API is uniform, let's now query the schema document element as "resolved" element for its item declarations:</p>

<pre><code>val resolvedSchemaDocElem =
    resolved.Elem(schemaDoc.documentElement)

val resolvedItemDecls =
    findAllItemDeclarations(resolvedSchemaDocElem)
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes we have a (mutable) JAXP DOM tree, and do not want to convert it to a yaidom immutable Elem tree. We can still use the yaidom query API to query those DOM elements. Function "findAllItemDeclarations" can still be called:</p>

<pre><code>val dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance
val db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder
val d = db.parse(new File("/path/to/HelloWorld.xsd"))

val wrapperDoc = dom.DomDocument(d)

val domItemDecls =
    findAllItemDeclarations(wrapperDoc.documentElement)
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes we want to use immutable elements, and still have access to the ancestry of each element. For example, when querying for item declarations, we need to inspect the document element for the target namespace. With so-called "indexed" elements, each element has indeed access to its ancestry.</p>

<p>This time using "indexed" elements, we again query for item declarations, but this time we need no separate query for the target namespace:</p>

<pre><code>val indexedSchemaDoc = indexed.Document(schemaDoc)

val indexedItemDecls =
    findAllItemDeclarations(indexedSchemaDoc.documentElement)

val targetENames: Set[EName] =
    (indexedItemDecls map { e =>
        val tnsOption = e.rootElem \@ EName("targetNamespace")
        val name = e.attribute(EName("name"))
        EName(tnsOption, name)
    }).toSet

require(
    factElems.map(e => e.resolvedName).toSet.subsetOf(targetENames))
</code></pre>

<p>There are more element implementations offering the same query API, such as wrappers for Scala XML Elems. Yaidom is extensible in this regard, since more element implementations can easily be created by mixing in some yaidom traits like ElemApi, and by implementing the methods that are abstract in those traits.</p>

<p>It was promised earlier to come up with a more robust "findAllItemDeclarations" method. This one only works for the "default" yaidom element implementation:</p>

<pre><code>def findAllItemDeclarations(docElem: Elem): immutable.IndexedSeq[Elem] = {
    import ElemApi._
    for {
        elemDecl <- docElem \ withEName(xsNamespace, "element")
        if elemDecl.attributeAsResolvedQNameOption(EName("substitutionGroup")) ==
            Some(EName(xbrliNamespace, "item"))
    } yield elemDecl
}
</code></pre>
